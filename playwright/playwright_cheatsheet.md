# JavaScript {#javascript}

## Chapter 1 : JavaScript Introduction {#chapter-1-:-javascript-introduction}

### What is JavaScript {#what-is-javascript}

**Interpreted Language**: JavaScript code is executed line-by-line by the browser's JavaScript engine.  
**Dynamic Typing**: Variables in JavaScript are not bound to any specific data type, and their type can change at runtime.  
**Prototype-Based**: JavaScript uses prototypes rather than classes for inheritance, allowing for flexible and dynamic object-oriented programming.  
**First-Class Functions**: Functions in JavaScript are treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.  
**Event-Driven**: JavaScript is often used to handle events such as user inputs, mouse movements, and keystrokes.  
**Single-Threaded**: JavaScript runs in a single-threaded environment, but it can handle asynchronous operations through callbacks, promises, and async/await.  
**Cross-Platform**: JavaScript can run on any device with a web browser, making it a highly versatile language for web development.

### What is console.log {#what-is-console.log}

**console.log** is used to output information to the web console/CMD console. In other words, it is actually an expression that retrieves the log property from the value held by console binding. It is helpful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to see the values of variables, the output of functions, and the flow of your program. Whatever value is given to console.log, gets displayed as output. Here are list of console method different options:

- console.log() //Output general logging information to the console
- console.warn() //Output a warning message to the console
- console.error() //Output an error message to the console
- console.info() //Output an informational message to the console
- console.debug() //Output a debug message to the console
- console.table() //Output data as a table to the console
- console.group() //Creates a new inline group in the console, which can be used to group together related message.
- console.time() //Starts a timer with a specific label
- console.timeEnd() //Stops the timer with a specified label and logs elapsed time
- console.clear() // clears the console
- console.count() // Logs the number of times this particular call to console.count() has been called with the given label
- console.countReset() // Reset the count for the specified label
- console.dir() // Displays an interactive listing of the properties of a specified JavaScript object
- console.trace() // Outputs a stack trace to the console

**How to write code in Chrome browser**  
**Developer Tools \-\> Sources \-\> Snippets \-\> New Snippet \-\> file name \-\> write code in right side pane \-\> Ctrl \+ S** to save file

### Random Number {#random-number}

**True Random Number**: are generated based on external factors e.g. generating randomness using surroundings noise. It is time consuming to generate.

**Pseudo Random Number**: are generated based on an algorithm and seed value. can be used in cryptography e.g. OTP  
**Math.random() :** returns a double type pseudo-random number, greater than or equal to zero and less than one. This is good enough for general purpose coding work.

let num \= Math.random() \-- return number between 0 and 1, every execution will generate new number

### Self Test

1. Create a hello.js file in Google chrome browser and print your name in the console.
2. Write code to generate a random number between 100 and 999\.
3. Declared 3 variable, name, age, phoneNumber and print in console.table();

## Chapter 2 : Data Types Introduction {#chapter-2-:-data-types-introduction}

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language which means that data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.

### Variable in JavaScript

1. **var**  
   var is the old way to declaring variables in javascript. Variables declared with var can be reassigned and redeclared within the same scope. It has function scope or global scope(if declared outside of a function)
   var x \= 5; //Declaring a variable ‘x’ and assigning the value 5 to it  
   console.log(x); //Output: 5
   var x \= 10; //Redeclaring variable ‘x’ and assigning new value 10\. This is allowed with ‘var’  
   console.log(x); //Output : 10
   function example(){  
   var y \=20;  
   console.log(y); //Output: 20  
   }  
   console.log(y); //Error : ‘y’ is not defined \- ‘var’ variables have function scope
2. **let**  
   It was introduced in ES6 and is not preferred/recommended way to declared variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with **let** can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope. The have block scope meaning they are limited to the block in which they are defined.
   let x \= 5; //Declaring a variable ‘x’ and assigning the value 5 to it  
   console.log(x); //Output: 5
   x \= 10; //Reassigning value of ‘x’  
   console.log(x); //Output : 10
   let x \= 30; //Error ‘x’ has already been declared \- redeclaration is not allowed with ‘let’  

3. **const**  
   const is also introduced in ES6. Variable declared with const **must be assigned a value when declared**, and this value **cannot be changed or reassigned**. It also has block scope.

   const PI \=3.24; //Declaring a constant ‘PI’ and assigning the value 3.14 to it

   console.log(PI); //Output : 3.14

   PI \= 3.14159; //Error: Assignment to constant variable \- can not reassign a constant variable

### Variable Naming conventions {#variable-naming-conventions}

- Names should be self descriptive with enough context so we don't have to comment out code
- Descriptive names are better than comments
- Avoid single letter names
- prefer explicit over implicit names
- Use descriptive loop indexes instead of i, j, k
- Avoid double negatives
- Use verb as a prefix for the function name
- No magic number or magic values, use a variable
- Don't use abbreviations or acronyms without sufficient contexts
- Make variable name as long as necessary if needed but no longer
- A prefix like is, are , or has helps to distinguish a boolean from another variable

#### **Variable Scope** {#variable-scope}

Declaring a variable in the global scope. its life span is whole program

var globalScopeVariable \= 7;  
function test() {  
//Declaring a variable in the function scope. It's life span is in function only  
 var functionScopeVariable \= 10;

//Declaring a variable in the local scope, inside a for loop. It's life span is inside for loop only  
 for (let index \= 0; index \< functionScopeVariable; index++) {  
 console.log(index);  
 }  
}

test();

console.log(functionScopeVariable); **//will throw error \- ReferenceError:** **functionScopeVariable is not defined**. Reason we are trying to use this outside of function scope

**Note :** Prefer not to use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope

### **Data Types** {#data-types}

In JavaScript, there are 7 Primitive Data types. List is as follows :

**1\. String**  
Strings are used to represent text. They are written by enclosing their content in quotes.  
let firstName \= ‘Abhay’ **//String data types (using single quote)**  
let secondName \= "Abhay" **//String data types (using double quote)**  
let name \= \`Abhay\` **//String data types (using backlinks)**

- firstName, secondName have pretty much the same behaviour.
- You can use single quote (‘’), double quote (“”) or backlinks(\`\`) to mark strings as long the quotes at the start and the end of the string match.
- String cannot be divided, multiplied or subtracted but \+/- operator can be used on them.
- Almost anything can be put between quotes and JavaScript will make a string value out of it.

But putting few characters are more difficult

- How to put quote between quotes \- **\\’**
- How to put newline in a string \- **\\n**
- How to put backslash inside a string \- **\\\\**

Whenever a backslash(\\) is found inside quoted text, it indicates that a character after it has special meaning. This is called escaping the character.

Backlink quotes string are called template **literals,** and can do few more things like embed other values. Example :  
 \`Half of 10 is ${10/5}\` **Output : Half of 10 is 5**  
   
**2\. number**  
Numbers can be integers (whole numbers) or floating-point numbers (decimal numbers). They are used for arithmetic operations and calculations.

let age \=18 **// number data types**

**3\. BigInt**  
It is suitable for large number calculations especially required in scientific application. To be honest, I never needed to use this in my programming journey.

**4\. Boolean**  
A boolean represents one of two values : true or false. Booleans are often used for logical operations and conditional statements.  
let isLoggedIn \= false **//boolean data types \-- true/false**

**5\. undefined**  
When you declare a variable & do not assign any value to it, it is undefined. ex.

let accountState;  
console.log(accountState);  
**Output :** \`undefined\` is the output of above code

**6\. null**  
let ab \= null **// it is a standalone value, its a type. representation of empty value**

**7\. Symbol**  
Symbols are unique and immutable values that can be used as identifiers for object properties. It is primarily used to avoid property name collisions in objects when multiple scripts or libraries are used together. To be honest, I never needed to use this in my programming journey.

**//How to define Symbol**  
_const id \= Symbol('123')_  
_const anotherId \=Symbol('123')_

Note : all primitive type uses **Stack Memory**, provides only value. it is passed as value, no reference is provided.

**Object Data Type**  
 **1\. An Object** (can have mixed data types) : An `Object` is a collection of properties, where each property has a key (or name) and a value. It is a collection of key-value pairs.  
 let myObj \= {  
 name:"Abhay",  
 age:22,  
 }  
 **2\. An Array :** An `Array` is an ordered list of values (elements), which can be of any data type, including other arrays and objects.  
 const heroes \= \["Shaktiman","nagraj"\]

**3\. A function :** A `Function` is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions can be assigned to variables and can be passed as arguments to other functions.  
 const myFunc \= function(){  
 console.log("hello world");  
 }

**Note :** All Non-Primitive or reference types provide reference (can directly refer memory address). Gets stored in **Heap Memory**

### Data Conversion {#data-conversion}

let score \= true;  
let valueInNumber \= Number (score);  
console.log(score);  
console.log(**typeof** valueInNumber); **// typeof tells about data type of value**  
console.log(valueInNumber);

**Outcome :**

1. if score \= 33, output will be number & 33
2. if score= "33" output will be number & 33
3. if score \= "33abc" output will be number & NaN
4. if score \= null output will be number & 0
5. if score \= undefined output will be number & NaN
6. if score \= true output will be number & 1

   **Boolean conversion**

   Boolean(score);

   1 \=\> true; 0 \=\> false

   "" \=\> false

   "abhay" \=\> true

### Automatic Type Conversion

When an operator is applied to the wrong tye of value, JavaScript will quietly convert that value to the type it needs, using a set of rules that often are not what you want or expect. This is called **Type Coercion.**  
console.log(8\*null);  
**Output : 0**

console.log("5"-1);  
**Output : 4**

console.log("5"+1);  
**Output : 51**

console.log("five"\*2);  
**Output : NaN**

console.log(false==0);  
**Output : true**

Arithmetic operations on NaN keep proceeding NaN. So if your code is showing one of these values, check for type coercion in your code.

### Conversion Operator {#conversion-operator}

let score \= "abh";  
console.log(typeof score);  
**//string**

console.log(typeof(score));  
 **//string**

let valueInNumber \= Number(score)  
console.log(typeof valueInNumber);  
**//number**

console.log(typeof(valueInNumber));  
**//number**

console.log(valueInNumber);  
**//NaN**

**Important Points :**

- "33" \=\> 33 can be converted easily
- "33abc" \=\> NaN (Not a number), typeof returns number for this
- true \=\> 1; false \=\>0
  let isLoggedIn \= "Abhay";  
  let booleanIsLoggedIn \= Boolean(isLoggedIn)  
  console.log(booleanIsLoggedIn); **//true**  
  console.log(typeof booleanIsLoggedIn); **//boolean**
  1 in Boolean is \=\> true  
  0 in Boolean is \=\> false  
  "Abhay" in Boolean is \=\> true
  let someNumber \= 33;  
  let stringNumber \= String(someNumber)  
  console.log(stringNumber);  
  **//Output : 33**
  console.log(typeof stringNumber);  
  **//Output : string**
  **Operations**  
  let value \=3;  
  let negValue \= \-value;  
   console.log(negValue);  
  **//Output : \-3**
  let str1 \="1"  
  let str2 \= 2  
  console.log("1"+2);  
  console.log(1+"2");  
  console.log("1"+2+2);  
  console.log(1+2+"2");  
  console.log(+true); **//senseless code**  
  console.log(+""); **//senseless code**
  let num1, num2, num3;  
  num1 \= num2=num3 \= 2+2; **//not a good way to write code, foremost focus should be on readability**
  let gameCounter \= 100;  
  \++gameCounter;  
  console.log(++gameCounter); **//prefix operator, increases value then print**  
  console.log(gameCounter++); **//postfix operation, prints and then increases values**

### Arithmetic Operator

**% remainder operator :** Using the remainder(%) operator is an easy way to test whether a number is divisible by another number. If it is the remainder of their division is zero.  
 console.log(10%2===0) **//Output : true**  
 console.log(11%2===0) **//Output : 1**

### Comparison Operator {#comparison-operator}

comparison of same data type is straight forward  
console.log(2\>1);  
console.log(2 \>=1);

**Different Data Types comparison**  
Problem arises when you compare two different data types  
console.log("2"\>1);  
console.log("02"\>1);  
console.log("02"\>2); // always convert data into same data type

**Null Comparison**  
console.log("=====null comparison \-- should avoid this type of conversion \======");  
console.log(null \>0);  
console.log(null \=== 0);  
console.log(null \>=0); // The reason is that an equality check \== and comparisons \>\< \>= \<= works differently. Comparisons convert null to a number, treating it as 0\. Thats why null \>=0 is true and null \> 0 is false

**Undefined Comparison**  
console.log("=====undefined comparison \-- should avoid this type of conversion \======");  
console.log(undefined \>0);  
console.log(undefined \== 0);  
console.log(undefined \>=0); // always returns false

//Query \-\> Comparison & Equality works differently  
// \=== checks strict comparison

### String {#string}

**How to Declare String**  
const name \= "Abhay"

**//another way to declare string**  
const gameName \= new String('Abhay Name');  
const repoCount \= 50;

console.log(\`Hello my name is ${name} and my repo count is ${repoCount}\`);  
**//this is called string interpolation, it allows to add methods like ${name.ToUppercase()}**

console.log(gameName);  
console.log(gameName\[1\]);  
console.log(gameName.\_\_proto\_\_);  
console.log(gameName.length); // get length of string value  
console.log(gameName.toUpperCase());  
console.log(gameName.charAt(1));

### Date {#date}

JavaScript Date objects represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format.

A JavaScript date is fundamentally specified as the time in milliseconds that has elapsed since the epoch, which is defined as the midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC (equivalent to the UNIX epoch). This timestamp is timezone-agnostic and uniquely defines an instant in history.

let myDate \= new Date();

console.log(myDate);  
**_//output : Fri Jul 12 2024 19:37:46 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)_**

console.log(typeof myDate);  
**//Output : object**

console.log(myDate.toString());  
**_//Output : Fri Jul 12 2024 19:37:46 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)_**

console.log(myDate.toLocaleDateString());  
**//Output : 7/12/2024**

_let myCreatedDate \= new Date(2023,0,23,5,3);_

_console.log(myCreatedDate);_  
**_//Output : Mon Jan 23 2023 05:03:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)_**

_let myCreatedDate1 \= new Date("2023-01-14"); //YYYY-MM-DD_

### Self Test

Exercise: To Do : All possible Data Type Conversion

## Chapter 3 : Array and Object {#chapter-3-:-array-and-object}

### Array {#array}

The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

arrays aren't primitives but are instead Array objects:

1. arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. (When those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.)
2. arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.
3. arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on — and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1\.
4. array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

   _const myArray \= \[1,2,3,4,true,"ABhay"\];_

   _console.log(myArray);_

const myHeroes \= new Array("C","A","B","D");  
console.log(myHeroes);

**Declare an array**  
 const myArray \= \[1,2,3,4,true,"Abhay"\];  
 console.log(myArray); //Output : \[1, 2, 3, 4, true, 'Abhay'\]

myArray\[1\] \= 10 **//valid operation although array is declared as const**  
 myArray \= \[2,3,4\] **//Invalid operation reason myArray is declared as const**

const myHeroes \= new Array("C","A","B","D");  
 console.log(myHeroes);

let ab= \[1,2,3,"B"\];  
 ab\[1\] \= 5;  
**//valid operation reason array is declared let**  
 ab \= \[4,5,7\]  
 console.log(ab);

#### **Array Methods** {#array-methods}

#### **push()** {#push()}

This method adds an element at the end of the current array. It modifies the original array.  
 let ab \= \[1,2\];  
 ab.push("Dhruva");  
 console.log(ab);  
 **//output : \[ 1, 2, 'Dhurva' \]**

**pop()**  
This method removes the last element from the original array and returns value. It modifies the original array.

_ab.pop();_  
 _let temp \= ab.pop()_  
 \*console.log(ab); **// \[1,2\]\***  
 \*console.log(temo); **//Dhruva\***

#### **unshift()** {#unshift()}

This method adds new element at the beginning of array  
 ab.unshift("A");  
 console.log(ab); **// \[ 'A', 1, 2 \]**

#### **shift()** {#shift()}

This method removes the first element from the original array and returns value. It modifies the original array.  
let temp \= ab.shift();  
console.log(ab); **// \[1,2\]**  
console.log(ab); **// A**

#### **includes()** {#includes()}

It checks for a given value in the array and returns true if the element is found else false.

**//returns true if element is found else false**  
console.log(myHeroes.includes("A"));

**//check if this value is in array**  
marks.includes(120)

#### **indexOf()** {#indexof()}

It checks for a given value in array and returns element index from array else \-1 if element is not found.

_let ab \= \['B',1,2\];_  
**_//index : 0 reason B is found at zero index_**  
_console.log(myHeroes.indexOf("B"));_

**_//index : \-1 reason 3 is not exist in array_**  
_console.log(myHeroes.indexOf("3"));_

#### **sort()** {#sort()}

This method sorts array values.  
\*console.log('Sort array values : ',myHeroes.sort()); **//sort array values\***

**Sort String Array**  
_let fruits \= \["Banana","Apple"\]_  
\*fruits.sort() **//return sorted array\***

**Sort Number Array**  
\*let fruits \= \[1,2,6,9,3,100,40\] **//return sorted array\***

**CAUTION:**  
Sorting does not give correct result when array has number as well as string values.

#### **toString()** {#tostring()}

It is a generic method applicable to all objects and convert an object's value to string. The values are separated by commas.

let ab \= \["ab","bc","da",10,5\];  
console.log('Convert array to String : ',myHeroes.toString()); **//10,5, ab,bc,dc**

#### **join()** {#join()}

join() method can only be used on array. It joins the array elements and returns a string. The values are separated by the commas (by default), using the \`join()\` method. We can also specify a separator.

_const newArra \= ab.join();_  
\*console.log(newArra ); **//10,5,ab,ca,da\***

\*const newArra \= ab.join(|); **//replace the default separator , by |\***

**\*//10|5|ab|ca|da : converts array to pipe operator** **separator value, typeOf new Array is \`string\`\***  
_console.log(newArra );_

#### **lastIndexOf()** {#lastindexof()}

This method returns the last index at which a given element can be found in the array.

let numbers \= \[1,2,3,4,5,5\];  
console.log(numbers);  
const lastIndex \= numbers.lastIndexOf(4);  
console.log(lastIndex); **_//Output : 3_**

#### **off()** {#off()}

This method creates a new array instance with a variable number of arguments, regardless of a number or type of the arguments.

let numbers \= Array.of(1,2,3,4,5,5,"four",true);  
console.log(numbers);  
**_//Output :_**  
**_\[_**  
 **_1, 2, 3,_**  
 **_4, 5, 5,_**  
 **_'four', true_**  
**_\]_**

#### **findIndex()** {#findindex()}

This method returns the index of the first element in an array that passes a test(provided as a function). If no element passes the test, it returns \-1.

#### **slice()** {#slice()}

slice() method returns selected elements in an array, as a new array. It selects from a given startNum, up to a(not inclusive) given end. It does not change the original method. We can use slice() method to create a new array from an existing array and without impacting the original array.

_const myArray \= \[0,1,2,3,4,5,6\];_  
_const b \= myArray.slice(1,3);_  
\*console.log("Original Array after slice : ",myArray); **//original array after slice : \[0,1,2,3,4,5,6\] : no impact on original array\***

\*console.log('newArray' , b); **// \[1,3\] : start from index : 1 and ends at 2 (not including index: 3\)\***

#### **splice()** {#splice()}

splice fetches elements from array, includes last range, also modifies original array. This can be used to cut the number of elements from the original array.  
We can use the splice() method to create a new array from an existing array and also remove the element in the original array.

_const myArray \= \[0,1,2,3,4,5,6\];_  
\*const c \= myArray.splice(1,3); **//extract elements from index:1 to index:3\***  
\*console.log("original array after splice : ",myArray); **//\[0,4,5,6\] : left with rest of element\***  
\*console.log('new Array : ',c); **//new array : \[1,2,3\] from existing\***

**Break the array**  
marks.slice(2,5)

#### **filter()** {#filter()}

The filter() method is an iterative method. It calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array, and constructs a new array of all the values for which callbackFn returns a truthy value. Array elements which do not pass the callbackFn test are not included in the new array. Filter() method creates a new array from an existing array with elements that pass a test provided by a function. It does not execute the function for empty elements. This method does not change the original array.

_const myNums \= \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\];_  
\*let newMyNums \= myNums.filter((num)=\>num\<4) **//you can write conditions here. If condition is wrapped inside {}, return keyword needs to be provided\***  
**_console.log(newMyNums);_**

_newMyNumsTwo \= myNums.filter((num)=\>{return num\<4})_  
_console.log(newMyNumsTwo);_

**How to filter below array which has 'world' in it**  
Creating an array of strings.  
var wordsArray \= \[  
 "hello-world",  
 "hello1-world",  
 "hello-we-world",  
 "hello-hello",  
 "jello-bello",  
\];

Filtering the array and returning the array which has the text "world" in it.  
var newArray \= wordsArray.filter((wordHavingTextAsWorld) \=\>  
 wordHavingTextAsWorld.includes("world")  
);

or with return statement  
newArray \= wordsArray.filter((wordHavingTextAsWorld) \=\> {  
 return wordHavingTextAsWorld.includes("world");  
});

Printing the array which has the text "**world**" in it.  
_console.log(newArray);_  
**//Output \-\> _//\[ 'hello-world', 'hello1-world', 'hello-we-world' \]_**

**Filter \-\> used to filter value from array**  
function isOdd(x) {  
 return x % 2;  
}

**function code outside filter**  
output \= arr.filter(isOdd);  
console.log(output);

**function code inside filter**  
output \= arr.filter(function isEven(x) {  
 return x % 2 \=== 0;  
});  
console.log(output);

**function code as arrow function**  
output \= arr.filter((x) \=\> x % 2 \=== 0);  
console.log(output);

#### **Map()** {#map()}

The map() method of Array instances creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.  
const myNums \= \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\];  
let newNums \= myNums.map((num)=\>num+10) **_//will iterate all element & add value 10_**  
console.log(newNums);

**Note** \- map should be preferred instead of foreach if ask is to iterate all element & perform some operation

**function Chaining**  
const m \= myNums.map((num)=\>num\*10).map((num)=\> num+1).filter((num)=\>num\>40);  
console.log(m);

**Re-write a for loop method in map()**  
**_// Sample JSON data_**

let json \= {  
 data: {  
 data: \[  
 { executiondate: "2023-06-28T12:34:56Z" },  
 { executiondate: "2023-07-01T08:22:11Z" }  
 \]  
 }  
};

**_//print json data on console_**

console.log(JSON.stringify(json));

{"data":{"data":\[{"executiondate":"2023-06-28T12:34:56Z"},{"executiondate":"2023-07-01T08:22:11Z"}\]}}

**_//Update executiondate key value using traditional for loop approach_**

for (let iLoop \= 0; iLoop \< json.data.data.length; iLoop++) {  
 let temp \= json.data.data\[iLoop\].executiondate.slice(0, 10\)  
 json.data.data\[iLoop\].executiondate \= temp  
}

**_// Use map to update executiondate_**

json.data.data \= json.data.data.map(item \=\> {  
 item.executiondate \= item.executiondate.slice(0, 10);  
 return item;  
});

**_// Log the updated JSON data_**

console.log(JSON.stringify(json));

**Output :**

{"data":{"data":\[{"executiondate":"2023-06-28"},{"executiondate":"2023-07-01"}\]}}

#### **forEach()**

This method executes a provided function once for each array element. It does not return anything, it just executes the callback function on each element of the array.

const mArray \= \["J", "k", "L"\];

**foreach with normal function**  
console.log("--- foreach with normal function \---");  
mArray.forEach(function (item) {  
//print all values of array, we can write any logic code within curly{} braces  
 console.log(item);  
 console.log(item \+ "Abhay");  
});

**foreach with arrow function**  
console.log("--- foreach with arrow function \---");  
mArray.forEach((item) \=\> {  
 console.log(item);  
});

**Using external or another function**  
console.log("--- foreach external or another function \---");  
function printMe(item) {  
 console.log(item);  
}

mArray.forEach(printMe);

#### **reduce()** {#reduce()}

Array.reduce() helps to perform different types of operation like segregation, aggregation, running things in sequence/series etc.

Syntax of Array.reduce()  
**//Verbose**  
arrName.reduce(callBackFn, initialValue);

**//Simplified, callback function with parameters**  
arrName.reduce((previousValue,currentValue,currentIndex,array) \=\>{  
 const nextValue \= previousValue+currentValue;  
return nextValue;  
},initialValue);

This method is used to reduce an array to a single value. It executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right), resulting in a single output value.

\-- To Do \-- read more on reduce function  
//reduce is used frequently in react  
const m \=\[1,3,4\];  
let initialVal \= 0;  
let newM \= m.reduce((accumulate,currVal)=\>{  
 console.log(\`accumulate : ${accumulate} : currVal : ${currVal}\`);  
 return accumulate+currVal;  
},initialVal)

console.log(newM);

**//count total price in shoppingCart**  
const shoppingCart \= \[  
 {  
 courese: "JS",  
 price: 100  
 },  
 {  
 courese: "React",  
 price: 200  
 },  
 {  
 courese: "Redux",  
 price: 300  
 }  
\]

let totalPrice \= shoppingCart.reduce((total,item)=\>{  
return total+item.price  
},0)  
console.log(totalPrice);

#### **push and concat operation on array** {#push-and-concat-operation-on-array}

**Problem Description**: You have two arrays  
_const marvelHeroes \= \["Thor", "IronMan"\];_  
_const marvelHeroes2 \= \["Thor", "Zorawar"\];_  
_const DCHeroes \= \["Spiderman","Batman"\];_  
_const DCHeroes2 \= \["Spiderman","Batman"\];_

**Use Case 1** : **Merge two arrays, no impact on original array**  
_marvelHeroes.push(DCHeroes);_  
**_// adds second array as child array, does not merge two array. modifies original array_**

_console.log(marvelHeroes);_  
**_//output : \['Thor', 'IronMan',\['Spiderman','Batman'\]\]_**

**Use Case 2 :** **Merge two arrays, no impact on original array**  
_marvelHeroes.push(DCHeroes);_  
**_// merge two array. modifies original array_**

_console.log(marvelHeroes);_  
**_//output : \['Thor', 'IronMan','Spiderman','Batman'\]_**

**CAUTION**  
concat() method is not much used, a better approach is using spread operator (...)

const newArrayUsingSpread \= \[...marvelHeroes2,...DCHeroes2\];  
console.log("Merge Array Using Spread Operator : ",newArrayUsingSpread); **_//output : \['Thor', 'IronMan','Spiderman','Batman'\]_**

#### **How to check if array isArray()** {#how-to-check-if-array-isarray()}

**isArray() :** method returns true if an object is an array otherwise false.  
console.log("isArray : ",Array.isArray("AB"));  
console.log("isArray : ",Array.isArray(flatArray));

**Converts String to array using Array.from()**  
Array.from() method returns an array from an object with length property.

**CAUTION**  
If you use Array.from() on an array, will return \`undefined\`  
\*console.log("Converts String to array : ",Array.from("ABC")); **//Converts String to Array : \['A','B','C'\]\***

#### **Converts variables to array**

let s1 \= 300;  
let s2 \= 400;  
let s3 \= 500;  
console.log("Converts variable to array : ",Array.of(s1,s2,s3));

#### **Mutating Array methods** {#mutating-array-methods}

Mutating array methods are one who mutate (Mutation is basically changing the array itself instead of returning a new array with the new changes) the original array right away, when executed.

It helps in following \-

- Avoid accidentally mutating : The original array should not be mutated right away
- Do Easier mind map
- These mutating methods need to be executed first

**Mutating Array Methods list**

- **.copywithin()** : use this to copy elements from within the array. It then replaces the pre-existing elements accordingly. This method shallow copies part of a array to another location in the same array and returns modified array without modifying its length.  
   TO DO – read more & find good example
- .splice()
- .fill()
- .pop() \- removes the last element from the array. This run on O(1) time .
- .push() \- Adds elements to the end of array. This run on O(1) time .
- .reverse() \-
- .sort()
- .unshift() \- Adds element to the beginning of an array. This runs in O(n) time reason have to duplicate/move the entire array.
- .shift() \- removes first element from the array. This runs in O(n) time reason have to duplicate/move the entire array.

**How to make arrays mutable**  
const kidsName \= \["Govind","Gopal","Pari","Kanhu","Aayu"\]

**//Make it immutable, user can not edit/update values & add new element in array**  
Object.freeze(kidsName)

**//If you try to add/update value of array, will throw TypeError**  
kidsName.push("Lal");  
kidsName\[1\] \="AB"  
**Output :**  
**_\`TypeError: Cannot add property 5, object is not extensible at Array.push (\<anonymous\>) at Object.\<anonymous\> (/home/runner/2wq0fv6bhic/index.js:6:10) at Module.\_compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:999:30)\`_**

#### **values()** {#values()}

This method returns an iterator that provides the values for each index in the array. It takes not arguments.

const arr \= \['apple','banana', 'cherry'\];  
const iterator \= arr.values()  
for (const value of iterator){  
console.log(value);  
}  
**Output :**  
apple  
banana  
Cherry

#### **length()** {#length()}

This property returns the length of the array.

const arr \= \['apple','banana','cherry'\];  
console.log(arr.length); **// Output: 3**

#### **reverse()** {#reverse()}

This method reverses the order of the elements in the array.  
const arr \= \['apple','banana','cherry'\];  
console.log(arr.reverse());  
**Output : \[ 'cherry', 'banana', 'apple' \]**

#### **at()** {#at()}

This method returns the element at the specified index in the array. It takes one argument, the index.

const arr \= \['apple','banana','cherry'\];  
console.log(arr.at(2)); **// Output: cherry**

#### **fill()** {#fill()}

This method fills all the elements of an array from a start index to an end index with static value. It can take up to three argument :

1. the value to fill
2. the start index
3. The end index

   const arr \= \['apple','banana','cherry'\];

   console.log(arr.fill('orange',1,2)); **_//Output : \[ 'apple', 'orange', 'cherry' \]_**

#### **from()** {#from()}

This method create a new array from an array like object or an iterable object. It can take up to two arguments: the object to convert to an array, and a mapping function to apply to each element of the new array.

const obj \= {0:'apple', 1: 'banana', 2:'cherry', length:3};  
const arr \= Array.from(obj);  
console.log(arr); **_//Output : \[ 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry' \]_**

#### **flat()** {#flat()}

Flattening an array is the process of taking nested array elements and basically putting them all into one "flat" array. It does not modify the original array.

**Use Case 1** : flat() method flattens up to one level deep  
const anArray \= \[1,2,3,\[4,5,6\],7,\[6,7,\[4,5\]\]\];  
const flatArray \=anArray.flat(); // \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,6,7,\[4,5\]\] : 2nd level nested array is not flatten  
console.log("Flatten the array : ",flatArray);

**Use Case 2** : flat() method flattens up to any level of deep nesting using \`infinity\` keyword  
const anArray \= \[1,2,3,\[4,5,6\],7,\[6,7,\[4,5\]\]\];

**// flatten the array till infinite hierarchy or flatten the arrays into single**  
const flatArray \=anArray.flat(Infinity);

console.log("Flatten the array : ",flatArray);  
**// \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,6,7,4,5\]**

#### **entries()**

Used to create an iterator object which iterates over the array, returning key/value pairs for each element, where key represents the index of the element in the array and value represents the element itself.

const fruits \= \[“apple”,”banana”,”cherry”\];  
const iterator \= fruits.entries();  
for (const\[index,fruits\] of iterator){  
 console.log(index,fruit);  
}

//Output :  
//0 “apple  
//1 “banana”  
//2 “orange”

#### **Array Destructuring**

Array destructuring allows you to extract elements from an array and assign them to variables.  
const numbers \= \[1, 2, 3\];  
const \[first, second, third\] \= numbers;  
console.log(first); // 1  
console.log(second); // 2  
console.log(third); // 3

You can **skip elements** in the array by leaving spaces between commas.  
const numbers \= \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\];  
const \[first, , third\] \= numbers;  
console.log(first); // 1  
console.log(third); // 3

**You can set default values if the element does not exist in the array.**  
const numbers \= \[1, 2\];  
const \[first, second, third \= 3\] \= numbers;  
console.log(third); // 3

**The rest operator can be used to collect the remaining elements into a new array.**  
const numbers \= \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\];  
const \[first, second, ...rest\] \= numbers;  
console.log(rest); // \[3, 4, 5\]

**Array destructuring can be used to swap the values of two variables.**  
let a \= 1;  
let b \= 2;  
\[a, b\] \= \[b, a\];  
console.log(a); // 2  
console.log(b); // 1

**Destructuring can also be used for nested arrays.**  
const numbers \= \[1, \[2, 3\], 4\];  
const \[first, \[second, third\], fourth\] \= numbers;  
console.log(second); // 2  
console.log(third); // 3

**Combining Object and Array Destructuring**  
You can combine object and array destructuring in more complex structures.  
const data \= {  
title: "Book Title",  
author: "Author Name",  
characters: \["Character1", "Character2", "Character3"\],  
};

const { title, characters: \[firstCharacter, , thirdCharacter\], } \= data;

console.log(title); // Book Title  
console.log(firstCharacter); // Character1  
console.log(thirdCharacter); // Character3

### Object {#object}

singleton \-\> constructor will create singleton object.

Object literals \-\> when we create object using literals it will not be singleton  
const jsUser \= {  
 name:"Abhay",  
 age: 18,  
 "full name":"A B"  
}

console.log(jsUser.name);  
console.log(jsUser\["name"\]);  
console.log(jsUser\["full name"\]);

**//Update value**  
jsUser.name="Pari";  
console.log(jsUser\["name"\]);

**//You can freeze an object, once freezed, value can't be changed**  
Object.freeze(jsUser);

jsUser\["name"\]="Shanvi";  
console.log(jsUser\["name"\]);

**//How to assign and access Symbol**  
const mySymbol1 \= Symbol("key1");  
const jsUserWithSymbol \= {  
 name:"Abhay",  
 \[mySymbol1\]:"key1",  
 age: 18,  
 "full name":"A B"  
}  
console.log(jsUserWithSymbol);

jsUserWithSymbol.greeting \= function(){  
 console.log("Hello AB");  
}  
console.log(jsUserWithSymbol.greeting());

jsUserWithSymbol.greeting2 \= function(){  
 console.log(\`Hello JS User , ${this.name}\`);  
}

console.log(jsUserWithSymbol.greeting2());

const td \= new Object(); **//This is a singleton, object is same as created in 03_Objects.js file. Only difference is singleton**  
console.log(td);

const regulatedUser \= {  
 email:"abc@hotmail.com",  
 fullname:{  
 userfullName:{  
 "firstname":"Abhay",  
 "secondname":"Bharti"  
 }  
 }  
}

// console.log(regulatedUser);  
// console.log(regulatedUser.fullname.userfullName.firstname);

#### **Optional chaining**

The optional chaining (?.) operator accesses an object's property or calls a function. If the object accessed or function called using this operator is undefined or null, the expression short circuits and evaluates to undefined instead of throwing an error.

// console.log(regulatedUser?.fullname?.userfullName?.firstname);

const o1 \= {1:"a",2:"b"};  
const o2 \= {3:"c",4:"d"};

const o3 \= {o1,o2}; **_//This creates object inside object_**  
// console.log(o3);

/**/Object.Assign**  
**//will merge two object and return a new object**  
const o4 \= Object.assign(o1,o2);  
// console.log("Using Object.assign Operator : ",o4);

**//Better way to do merge two object is spread operator**  
const o5 \= {...o1,...o2};  
// console.log("Using Spread Operator : ",o5);

// console.log(Object.keys(o1)); **//returns key of object**  
// console.log(Object.values(o1)); **//return value of object**  
// console.log(Object.entries(o1)); **//returns array of key/value pair**

**//hasOwnProperty method returns true if key exists else false**  
// console.log(o1.hasOwnProperty('1')); **//return true**  
// console.log(o1.hasOwnProperty('A')); **//return false**

**Destructuring Of Objects**  
const course \= {  
 name:"Java",  
 price: 400  
}

**Access value of an Object property using object name.property name**  
console.log(course.price);  
const {price} \= course;  
console.log("price : ",price); //access value after object destructuring  
const {name:n}=course; //can assign a new name at the time of destructuring  
console.log(n);

Object destructuring is useful when passing props to React component

**To Do How to Destructure An Array**

#### Self Test

The following questions will help you measure your understanding of array

**1\. Create an array of numbers from 1 to 5 and log the array to the console**  
 **Code:**  
**let numberArray5 \= \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\];**  
 **for (let iLoop \= 0; iLoop \< numberArray5.length; iLoop\++) {**  
 **console.log(numberArray5\[iLoop\]);**  
**}**

**2\. Access the first and last elements of the array and log them to the**  
 **console**  
**console.log(numberArray5\[0\]);**  
**console.log(numberArray5\[4\]);**

## Chapter 4 : Function {#chapter-4-:-function}

**Objectives:**

- Declaration
- Expression
- Arrow Functions
- Parameters and Arguments
- Return Values
- Higher-Order Functions
- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
- Two minute drill  
  **Self Test**

### Expression

Anything that produces a value is an expression in JavaScript, which means function calls can be used within a larger expression. Example:  
 console.log(Math.min(10,20)+10);  
 **Output: 20**

function hello(){  
 console.log("A");  
}

// hello; **//This return reference of a function, useful in React component**  
// hello() **//This statement executes a function**

### Function

A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It is fundamental building block of JavaScript programs, allowing to organize code, make it more modular and avoid duplicate code.

A function is created with an expression that starts with the keyword function. Function have a set of parameters and a body which contains the statements that are to be executed when function is called. A function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all.

A return statement determines the value the function returns. When control comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned value to the code that called the function. A return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return **undefined**. Function which does not have return statement returns **undefined.**

In JavaScript, there are three main approaches to declare a function:

1. #### **Declaration Notation (Function Declaration)**

This is a function declaration. It is a slightly shorter way to create a function and does not require a semicolon after the function. Create function using the function keyword.

//calling the function  
 console.log(“function call : ”+userName(“Abhay”));

    //function declaration

function userName(name){  
 return name;  
}

//calling the function  
 console.log(“function call : ”+userName(“Abhay”));

The preceding code works, even though the function is defined below the code that uses it. Functional declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom flow of control. They are conceptually moved to the top of their scope and can be used by all the code in that scope. This is useful because it offers the freedom to order code in a way that seems meaningful, without worrying about having to define all functions before they are used.

2. #### **Functions As Values (Function Expression)**

A function binding usually simply acts as a name for a specific piece of the program. It is possible to store function value in new binding, pass it as an argument to a function. In this approach, function is assigned to a variable. It can not be called before it is defined in the code. It can be **named** or **anonymous**. When it is **anonymous the function does not have a name** unless assigned to a variable.  
   
//Anonymous function expression  
 let printName \= function(){  
 console.log(“hello js”);  
}

//Named function expression  
 let printName \= function SayHello(){  
 console.log(“hello js”);  
}

**Difference between anonymous and named Function**:

| Anonymous                                                                                                                                                                                        | Name                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The function has no name                                                                                                                                                                         | The function has a name                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Cannot refer to itself by name within its own body                                                                                                                                               | Can refer to itself by name within its own body, which is useful for recursion.                                                                                                                  |
| When debugging, stack trace may show the function as anonymous, making it harder to identify                                                                                                     | Function name will appear in stack traces, which can make debugging easier.                                                                                                                      |
| Both anonymous and named function expressions are not hoisted, meaning they are not available before their definition in the code. This contrasts with function declarations, which are hoisted. | Both anonymous and named function expressions are not hoisted, meaning they are not available before their definition in the code. This contrasts with function declarations, which are hoisted. |

3. #### **Arrow Function**

This is the third notation of functions. Instead of the function keyword, it uses an arrow (**\=\>**) made up of an equal sign and a greater than character.

const printName \= (firstName, secondName) \=\>{  
return firstName+” ” \+ secondName;  
}

The arrow comes after the list of parameters and is followed by the function’s body. It expresses something like “this input (this parameters) produces this result(the body)”.

When there is only one parameter name, you can omit the parentheses around the parameter lists. If the body is a single expression, rather than a block in braces, that expression will be returned from the function.

    const name \= (name) \=\> {return name;};

const name \= name \=\> return name;

When an arrow function has not parameters at all, its parameters list is just an empty set of parameters.

Arrow function was added in 2015, it allows writing small function expressions in a less verbose way.

const user \= {  
 name:"AB",  
 price:999,  
 welcomeMessage:function(){  
 console.log(\`${this.name}, welcome to Website\`); //this contains all variables of the object.  
 }  
}

//Note : This context works only inside object, does not work in function.  
console.log(user.welcomeMessage());  
user.name \="Ajay" //change value of name field  
console.log(user.welcomeMessage()); //print updated value

console.log("this in node : ",this); // {} \- in node, this prints {}. If you print console.log(this) in chrome browser console, it will prints windows context

function hello(){  
 let name \= "Abhay";  
 console.log("name : ",this.name); //prints undefined (behaviour is same in arrow function)  
}  
hello()

**Why we need arrow function**  
If function scope is added in arrow function like {}, means if curly braces is used, you need to use return keyword to return value from function. Otherwise function will not return any value

const addTwo \= (n1,n2) \=\>{  
 return n1+n2;  
}  
console.log("Explicit return ", addTwo(5,7));

if written like below or like const addThree \= (n1,n2,n3) \=\> n1+n2+n3;, will automatically return value. No need to use the return keyword. This is called implicit arrow function. This is used a lot in ReactJS.

const addThree \= (n1,n2,n3) \=\> (n1+n2+n3);  
console.log("Implicit return",addThree(5,7,2));

**Return Object from Arrow function**  
const returnObjectFromArrowFunction \= (n1,n2) \=\>  
 ({name:n1,age:n2}) //to return object, need to wrap object in () braces

console.log(returnObjectFromArrowFunction("AB",23));

**check for undefined value using if operator**  
function userName(name){  
 **//Check for null and undefined**  
 if (name \=== undefined){  
 console.log("Enter a username");  
 return;  
 }  
 return \`${name} just logged in\`  
}

console.log(userName("Abhay"));  
console.log(userName());

**We can use logical Not (\!) operator to check for null or undefined value**  
function userName2(name){  
 //Check for null and undefined  
 if (\!name ){  
 console.log("Enter a username");  
 return;  
 }  
 return \`${name} just logged in\`  
}

console.log(userName2("Abhay"));  
console.log(userName2());

//To Do \- Rest Operator  
function calculateCartPrice(...num){  
 return num;  
}  
console.log(calculateCartPrice(100,200,300)); //return an array as \[100,200,300\]

//Passing Object as a parameter in function

const aObject \= {  
 name:"Abhay",  
 price: 299  
}

function A(anObject){  
 console.log(\`${anObject.name} and ${anObject.price}\`);  
}

A(aObject);

**Passing array to functions**  
function returnsSecondValueFromArray(getArray){  
 return getArray\[1\];  
}

const myArray \= \[3,4,6,8\];  
console.log("passing array as function : ",returnsSecondValueFromArray(myArray));

**pass array as parameters**  
console.log("passing array directly as function : ",returnsSecondValueFromArray(\[8,9,10\])); //passing arrays as directly as params

console.log(addOne(6));

This approach of function declaration, you can call function execution statement before definition is written. This is called Hoisting.  
function addOne(num){  
 return num+1;  
}

console.log(addOne(5));

//In this approach, function execution statement should be after definition. Otherwise, will throw \`Cannot access 'addTwo' before initialization\` errror  
const addTwo \= function (num){  
 return num+2;  
}  
console.log(addTwo(10));

**Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**

**//name IIFE function**  
(function chai(){  
 console.log('DB Connected');  
})(); **//This will get executed**

**Notes :**  
 1\. function definition should be wrapper in ()  
 2\. () Should be appended at the end of first braces  
 3\. Should add ; at the end, to end context

**Why we need IIFE, practical need**  
This helps to avoid pollution due to global scope.

**unname IIFE function**  
( ()=\>{  
 console.log('DB Connected using arrow function');  
})(); **//IIFE with arrow function**

**unname IIFE function with params**  
( (name)=\>{  
 console.log(\`${name} DB Connected using arrow function\`);  
})("AB"); **//IIFE with arrow function**

i. First Class Function  
ii. Immediately Invoked Function

### Higher Order Function

A higher order function is a function that either takes another function as an argument, returns a function or both. Think of it like a function that operates on other functions.

//defining a higher-order function name “operate”  
function operate(a,b, operation){  
return operation(a,b); //This function takes two number and an operation function  
}

//defining some operation functions  
function addition(a,b){  
return a+b;  
}

function subtraction(a,b){  
return a-b;  
}

//calling the higher order function “operate” with addition function  
Var result1 \= operate(5,3,addition);  
console.log(result1); //Output : 8

//calling the higher order function “operate” with subtraction function  
Var result1 \= operate(5,3,subtraction);  
console.log(result1); //Output : 2

### **Callback Function**

It is a concept where a function is passed as arguments to other functions to be executed later, generally after some asynchronous operation completes.

    Function fetchData(callBack){
    	console.log(“fetchData has been called”);
    	setTimeout(()=\>{
    		const data \= “Some fetched data”;
    		callback(data);

},5000);  
}

function processData(data){  
 console.log(“Processing data :”,data);  
}  
fetchData(processData);

It allows us to execute code asynchronously and handle the result once it is available, making JavaScript suitable for handling tasks like fetch data from servers, reading files or handling user input without blocking the main thread.

### **Function Scope**

Every function in JavaScript creates its own scope. Scope refers to the **visibility of variables.** Variables declared inside a function are **only accessible within that function.**

    function sayName(){
    	var name \= “Abhay”;
    	console.log(name);

}  
sayName(); //Output : Abhay  
console.log(name); //this will throw error because ‘name’ is not defined outside the function

### Closure

In simple terms, closure is bundling of two or more function where inner function have access to the properties and methods of the outer function even after the execution of the external function is done.

A closure is when a function remembers the variables around it even when that function is executed elsewhere. Imaging, you have a function, and inside that function, there is another function. Now, this inner function has access to the variables of the outer function, even after the outer function has finished running. This ability of inner function to remember and access variables of its outer function is called closure.

function outerFunction(){  
 //Outer scoped  
 let name \= "I am outer function";  
 function innerFunction(){  
 console.log(name);  
 }  
 innerFunction();  
}

outerFunction(); //Output : I am outer function

In above code example, variable name is declared above the function **innerFunction(),** but it can be access inside it. This because variables are lexical scope in JavaScript and can be accessed anywhere inside the scope unless and util they are overridden. In above code block, variable is function scoped and it can be accessed anywhere within the function body (even in inner function).

function outerFunction(){  
 //Outer scoped  
 let name \= "I am outer function";  
 function innerFunction(){  
 //new variable with the same name declared in  
 //new scope this will be printed reason nearest one is given preference  
 let name \= "I am inner function";  
 console.log(name);  
 }  
 innerFunction();  
}

outerFunction(); //Output : I am inner function  
Reason preference is always given to the nearest declared one.

Lets take another example:

function outerFunction(){  
let temp \= "Hello";  
 function innerFunction(name){  
 return temp+" , "+name;  
 }  
 return innerFunction;  
}

//outerFunction will return a function that will accept an argument  
const fn \= outerFunction();

//pass the argument and it will concatenate with the temp variable that is in the outer scope and return a new value.  
let total \= fn("I am caller");

console.log(total); //Output : Hello, I am caller

In above example, we are returning the inner function, it will have access to the variables (it will be alive) in the outer scope and perform all sort of operations.

Not only variables but can also access all the other properties and methods of the outer function, not just parent but any level in the scope it is declared.

function x(a){  
 function y(b){  
 function z(c){  
 return a+b+c;  
 }  
 return z;  
 }  
 return y;  
}

//the outer function accepts an arguments and return a function  
const a \= x(100);  
console.log(a);

//First level inner function also accepts an argument and return the total of both outer and inner argument  
let b \= a(200);  
console.log(b);

//Second level inner function also accepts an argument and return total value  
let c \= b(200);  
console.log(c);  
//Output :  
\[Function: y\]  
\[Function: z\]  
500

## Chapter 4 : Control Flow and Loops {#chapter-4-:-control-flow-and-loops}

### If condition

**Pattern**  
if (condition) {  
 //code block to execute if condition is true  
} else {  
 //code block to execute if condition is false  
}

**Example**  
let num=10;  
if (num \> 10){  
console.log(“Number is greater than 10’);  
}else{  
console.log(“Number is less than 10’);  
}

const status \= 'online'

if (status \==='online' || status \=== 'away' || status \==='busy'){  
console.log('Do Something')  
}

**\*\*A better approach\*\***

if (\['online','away', 'busy'\].indexOf(status)\!== \-1){ console.log('Do Something') }\`

\`Check IndexOf with \`\~\` operator\`

if (\~\['online','away', 'busy'\].indexOf(status)){  
 console.log('Do Something')  
}

**Even better, using includes method**

if (\['online','away', 'busy'\].includes(status)){  
 console.log('Do Something')  
}

### Switch

**Pattern**  
switch (key) {  
 case value:

        break;

    default:
        break;

}  
**Example**

**Pattern to pass case value as expression**  
In switch() statement pass true instead of value.  
switch (true) {  
 case value \> 10:  
 break;  
 default:  
 break;  
}  
**Example**  
switch (true) {  
 case value \> 10:  
 console.log(“value is greater than 10”);  
 break;

    default:
        break;

}  
**Using Object Literals Instead of Switch Case**

function to getMarkRange() using switch case

function getMarkRange(grade) {  
let range;  
//Checking the value of the grade variable and returning the range of the grade using Switch case  
switch (grade) {  
case "A":  
range \= "100-70";  
Break;  
case "B":  
range \= "40-69";  
Break;  
case "C":  
range \= "0-39";  
Break;  
}  
return \`range is ${range}\`;  
}  
console.log(getMarkRange("B"));

**function to getMarkRange() using Object literal**

function getMarkRangeWithObjectLiteral(grade) {  
let range \= {  
A: "100-70",  
B: "40-69",  
C: "0-39",  
}\[grade\];  
return \`range is ${range}\`;  
}  
console.log(getMarkRange("B"));

**VSCODE tips to copy/paste/delete code using keyboard shortcut**

1. Duplicate a Line/Code Block: place your cursor on a line or select a code block & press \[Shift \+ Alt \+ Down Arrow key\]. Code will be duplicated.
2. Delete a Line/Code Block: place your cursor on a line or select a code block & press \[Crtl \+ Shift \+ k\]. Code will be removed.
3. Paste from history of all Copy/Cut items: There is no inbuilt feature available in \#VSCODE. Here is a workaround, install extension \#Clipboard Manager. This extension keeps history of copy/cut operation in VS Code. Press \[Crtl \+ Shift \+ V\], it will show history of values, you can select which one you want to paste.

### truthy/falsy value {#truthy/falsy-value}

**//Truthy/Falsy value**  
const user \= "ABC@ai";  
if (user){  
 console.log(\`Found user ${user}\`);  
}else {  
 console.log(\`Not Found user \`); // this will be printed if user \= ""  
}

**//falsy values List**  
//false,0,-0,BigInt 0n,'', null,undefined, Nan

**//truthy values List**  
//"0",'false',' ',\[\],{},function()

**//How to check truthy for array**  
const userArray \= \[\];  
if (userArray.length \=== 0){ **//code to check for truthy value for array, is empty**  
 console.log("Array is empty");  
}

**//How to check truthy for array**  
const emptyOb \={};  
**//get keys list & check if length is zero**  
if (Object.keys(emptyOb).length \===0){  
 console.log("Object is empty");  
}

false \== 0 //true  
false \== '' //true  
0 \== '' //true

//Nullish Coalescing Operator(??)  
//:null undefined \- It assigns whatever first valid value is found

let val;  
val \= null ?? 10;  
console.log(val);  
val \= 5 ?? 10;  
console.log(val);  
val \= undefined ?? 15;  
console.log(val);

val \= undefined ?? null??20;  
console.log(val);

//Ternary Operator  
//test condition? true:false  
const price \=100;  
price \>=80?console.log("less than 80"):console.log('More than 80');

### For loop {#for-loop}

const arr \= \[1,2,3,5,6\]

//ForOF to iterate on an array  
for (const num of arr) {  
 console.log(num); //print all values of an array  
}

const h \= "hello";  
for (const char of h) {  
 console.log(char); //print all character of a string  
}

//JavaScript Map  
//To Do \- What is Map  
const myMap \= new Map();  
myMap.set('A',1);  
myMap.set('B',3);  
myMap.set('C',5);  
console.log(myMap); //prints map \-\> Map(3) { 'A' \=\> 1, 'B' \=\> 3, 'C' \=\> 5 }

**Iterator an Map & destructure array returned for each key/value pair, \[key,val\] is** destructuring map key/value to key & val  
for (const \[key,val\] of myMap) {  
 console.log(\`key : ${key} \-:- val : ${val}\`);  
}

**Note** : When we run a forof loop on Map, each element is returned as an array. We need to do it in two step,  
 1\. iterate through Map key/value pair using forof  
 2\. Desktructure each array (containing key/value pair) in two key & value  
 3\. Above approach can't be used on Object, forOf can't be used on Map  
 4\. for of loop is used on Array/Map

**How to iterate an Object**  
const myObj \= {  
 k:"one",  
 l:"two"  
}  
//We need ForIn to iteration over object & access value  
for (const key in myObj) {  
 console.log(\`key : ${key} : value : ${myObj\[key\]}\`); //print all values  
}

**Note** : We can use ForIn on array, but can't use them on Map. Map is not an iterable.

**ForIn on array**  
const anAray \= \[1,2,3,6\];  
for (const key in anAray) {  
 console.log(anAray\[key\]);  
}

**forEach() Example**  
This method executes a provided function once for each array element. It does not return anything, it just executes the callback function on each element of the array.

const mArray \= \["J", "k", "L"\];

**foreach with normal function**  
console.log("--- foreach with normal function \---");  
mArray.forEach(function (item) {  
//print all values of array, we can write any logic code within curly{} braces  
 console.log(item);  
 console.log(item \+ "Abhay");  
});

**foreach with arrow function**  
console.log("--- foreach with arrow function \---");  
mArray.forEach((item) \=\> {  
 console.log(item);  
});

**Using external or another function**  
console.log("--- foreach external or another function \---");  
function printMe(item) {  
 console.log(item);  
}

mArray.forEach(printMe);

**foreach has access to item, index & full array**  
console.log("--- foreach has access to item, index & full array \---");  
mArray.forEach((item, index, arr) \=\> {  
 console.log(item, index, arr);  
});

**ForOff Example**  
for (let vehicle of carShowRoom){  
 console.log(\`Name: ${vehicle.name} Model : ${vehicle.model}\`)  
}

#### **Array Of Objects**

const mCode \= \[  
 {name:"JS",file:'.js'},  
 {name:"Java",file:'.java'},  
 {name:"python",file:'.py'}  
\]

mCode.forEach((item)=\>{  
 console.log(item.name,item.file);  
})

**Notes** \- foreach does not return any value, better usable methods are filter/map/reduce

**How to return value using ForEach**  
 const myNums \= \[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\];  
 const newNums \= \[\];  
 myNums.forEach((num)=\>{  
 if (num \> 4){  
 newNums.push(num)  
 }  
 })  
 console.log(newNums);

### While loop {#while-loop}

**Using while loop**

let index \=0;  
while(index\<carShowRoom.length){  
 console.log(carShowRoom\[index\].name)  
 index++;  
}

**Output**:

Maruti  
Tata  
Mahindra  
Benz

### Using Do while loop

A do loop is a control structure similar to while loop. It differs only on one point: a do loop always executes its body at least once and it starts testing whether it should stop only after the first execution. Reason is simple, test condition appears after the body of the loop.

let index \=0;  
do {  
 console.log(carShowRoom\[index\].name)  
 index++;  
}while(index\<carShowRoom.length)

**Output:**  
Maruti  
Tata  
Mahindra  
Benz

### Breaking Out Of a Loop

Having the looping condition produce false is not the only way a loop can finish. There is a special statement called **break** that has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop.

for (let iLoop \=0; iLoop \< 10; iLoop++){  
 If (iLoop%2===0){  
 Break; // this break statement will exit from executing loop  
 }  
}

**Output :**

### Continue : Skip Iteration of a Loop

The **continue** keyword is encountered in a loop body, controls jumps out of the body and continues with the loop's next iteration.

for (let iLoop \=0; iLoop \< 10; iLoop++){  
If (iLoop%2===0){  
 continue; // skip to next iteration  
 }  
 console.log(iLoop);  
}

**Output :**

## Chapter 5: Promise and Async Await {#chapter-5:-promise-and-async-await}

### promise {#promise}

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

![][image1]

**pending**: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.  
**fulfilled**: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.  
**rejected**: meaning that the operation failed.

const promiseOne \= new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {  
 //Do an async task  
 //DB calls, cryptography, network  
 setTimeout(function () {  
 console.log("Async task is completed");  
 resolve();  
 }, 1000);  
});

promiseOne.then(function () {  
 console.log("Promise consumed");  
});

**//2nd promise**  
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {  
 setTimeout(function () {  
 console.log("Async task 2");  
 resolve();  
 }, 1000);  
}).then(function () {  
 console.log("Async 2 resolved");  
});

//**3rd promise \-- pass data through resolve**  
const promiseThree \= new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {  
 setTimeout(function () {  
 resolve({ username: "chai", email: "chai@gmail.com" });  
 }, 1000);  
});

promiseThree.then(function (user) {  
 console.log(user);  
});

**//4th Promise**  
const promiseFour \= new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {  
 setTimeout(function () {  
 let error \= true;  
 if (\!error) {  
 resolve({ username: "hitesh", email: "123" });  
 } else {  
 reject("ERROR: Something went wrong");  
 }  
 }, 1000);  
});

promiseFour  
 .then((user) \=\> {  
 console.log(user);  
 return user.username;  
 })  
 .then((username) \=\> {  
 console.log(username);  
 })  
 .catch((error) \=\> {  
 console.log(error);  
 })  
 .finally(() \=\> {  
 console.log("Finally block \-- THe promise is finally resolved or rejected");  
 });

**//promise 5**  
const promiseFive \= new Promise((resolve, reject) \=\> {  
 setTimeout(() \=\> {  
 let error \= true;  
 if (\!error) {  
 resolve({ username: "javascript", email: "123" });  
 } else {  
 reject("ERROR: JS went wrong");  
 }  
 }, 1000);  
});

async function consumePromiseFive() {  
 try {  
 const response \= await promiseFive;  
 console.log(response);  
 } catch (error) {  
 console.log(error);  
 }  
}

consumePromiseFive();

**//promise 6**  
async function getAllUsers() {  
 try {  
 const response \= await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");  
 //console.log(response);  
 const data \= await response.json();  
 console.log(data);  
 } catch (error) {  
 console.log("E:", error);  
 }  
}  
getAllUsers();

console.log("----------------------------------");  
// fetch with then/catch  
fetch("https://api.github.com/users/abhaybharti")  
 .then((response) \=\> {  
 return response.json();  
 })  
 .then((data) \=\> {  
 console.log(data);  
 })  
 .catch((error) \=\> {  
 console.log(error);  
 });

//To Do \- read more about fetch api  
 // Micro task queue or priority queue contains fetch request. It gets added on top of call stack.

### Async Await

JavaScript is a single threaded, meaning it can do only only thing at at time. When you have tasks that take time, like fetching data from server or reading a file. JavaScript traditionally handle these with asynchronous code. Promises are a way to manage asynchronous operation, but they can sometimes lead to complex nested code structures. Async/Await is newer way to write asynchronous code that makes it look and behave more like synchronous code. It is built on top of promises, making asynchronous code easier to read and write.

**//Traditional Promise Approach**  
function fetchData(){  
 setTimeOut(()=\>{  
 resolve(“Data fetched successfully”);  
 },2000); //Simulating a delay of 2 seconds  
 }));  
}

fetchData().then((data)=\>;  
}).catch((error)=\>{  
 console.error(“Error:”,error);  
});

**//Async/await approach**  
async functional fetchData(){  
 return new Promise((resolve,reject) \=\>{  
 setTimeOut(()=\>{  
 resolve(“Data fetched successfully”);  
},2000); //simulating a delay of 2 seconds  
}));  
}

async function getData(){  
 try{  
 const data \= await fetchData();  
 console.log(data);  
}catch(error){  
 console.error(“Error:”, error);  
}  
}  
getData();

### Error Handling

#### **try-catch blocks**

The catch block lets you define a block of code to be executed if an error occurs in the try block. If an error occurs within the try block, JavaScript stops executing the code inside it an jumps to the catch block.

try{  
//code that might throw an error  
let result \= 10/0; //this will cause a division by zero error  
console.log(“Result:”,result);  
}catch(error){  
 console.log(“This code always runs, regardless of whether an error occurred or not”);  
}

It is handle errors to prevent your program from crashing unexpectedly. You can multiple catch blocks to handle different type of errors. You can also use finally block after catch to execute code regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

try{  
 let result \= someUndefined variable /10; //This will throw a reference Error   
 console.log(“Result”, result);  
}catch(referenceError){  
 console.log(“ReferenceError occurred : ”,referenceError);  
}finally{  
 console.log(“This code always runs, regardless of whether an error occurred or not”);  
}

#### **Error Objects**

When an error occurs, JavaScript generates an error object, which provides information about the error type, message and sometimes a stack trace to help you identity and debug the issue. The Error object is a built-in JavaScript object that provides information about error that occurs during runtime. It has two main properties:

1. name: A string representing the name of error. For example “syntaxError, “TypeError” etc
2. message: A human readable string providing details about the error

try{  
//code that might throw an error  
throw new Error(“Something went wrong”);  
}catch(error){  
 console.log(“Error : ”, error.message);  
}

### Modules

Modules allows to split code into reusable pieces, which can be imported and exported between different parts of your application. This helps with organising and maintaining your codebase, promoting reusability and avoiding global scope pollution.

#### Exporting and Importing

1. Named Exports  
   It allows you to export multiple items from a module and the must be imported using the exact names by which they were exported. This is useful when you want to export multiple functions, objects or variables from a single module.
   **//export from math.js**  
   export function add(a,b){  
   return a+b;  
   }
   export function subtract(a,b){  
   return a-b;  
   }
   **//import from math.js**  
   Import {add,subtract} from “./math.js”;  
   console.log(add(2,5)); //Output : 7  
   console.log(subtract(6,3)); //Output : 3  

2. **Default Export**  
   A default export allows to export a single value from a module and it can be imported with any name. This is useful when a module is expected to export a single main functionality or value.

   **//export from math.js**  
   function add(a,b){  
   return a+b;  
   }

   function subtract(a,b){  
   return a-b;  
   }

   **//Exporting the function individually**  
   Export {add,subtract};

   **//Alternatively you can also create an aggregate export**  
   const matchOperations \= {add,subtract};

   **//import from math.js**  
   **//importing named exports**  
   Import {add,subtract} from “./math.js”;

   **//importing the aggregate export**  
   Import mathOperations from “./math.js”

   console.log(add(2,5)); //Output : 7

3. **Aggregate Export**  
   Aggregating export allows to re-export items from other modules. This is useful when you want to create a central module that consolidate exports from multiple modules, simplifying import statements in other parts of your codebase.

   **//export from math.js**  
   export default function add(a,b){  
   return a+b;  
   }

   **//import from math.js**  
   Import add from “./math.js”;  
   console.log(add(2,5)); //Output : 7

4. **Aggregating Module**  
   Create a central module that re-exports all the function from the individual modules.  
   **//export from add.js**  
   export function add(a,b){  
   return a+b;  
   }
   **//export from subtract.js**  
   export function subtract(a,b){  
   return a-b;  
   }
   **//mathOperations.js**  
   //Re-exporting named exports from individual modules  
   export {add} from “./add.js” or  
   export \* from “./add.js”  
   export {subtract} from “./subtract.js”
   //main.js  
   **//importing from aggregating modules**  
   Import {add,subtract} from “./mathOperations.js”;  
   console.log(add(2,5)); //Output : 7  
   console.log(subtract(6,3)); //Output : 3

#### **CommonJs (Node.js modules)**

It is a specification for module system that allows you to use “**require**” to load modules and “**module.exports**” to export them. It is designed to work on the server side primarily in Node.js

**//export from math.js**  
function add(a,b){  
 return a+b;  
}

function subtract(a,b){  
 return a-b;  
}  
module.exports \= {  
 add,subtract  
}

**//import to app.js**  
const math \= require(“./math”);

const sum \= math.add(5,3);  
const difference \= math.subtract(5,3);

console.log(“Sum:”,sum); // Output : Sum : 8  
console.log(“Difference:”,difference); // Output : difference: 8

**Note** : You can export a single function or value directly (single exports) or you can export parts of your module individually(Partial Exports).

**//Single Exports**  
**//logger.js**  
module.exports \= function log(message){  
 console.log(message);  
}

**//app.js**  
const log \= require(“./logger”);  
log(“Hello, CommonJs\!”);

**//Partial Exports**  
**//utilities.js**  
export sayHello \= function(){  
 console.log(“Hello”);  
}

export sayGoodBye \= function(){  
 console.log(“GoodBye”);  
}

**//app.js**  
const utilities \= require(“./utilities”);  
utilities.sayHello(); //Output : Hello  
utilities.sayGoodBye(); //Output : GoodBye

## Chapter 6 : Class and Loops {#chapter-6-:-class-and-loops}

### OOPs {#oops}

It is a programming paradigm.

### Object {#object-1}

function multiplyBy5(num) {  
 this.num \= num;  
 return num \* 5;  
}  
multiplyBy5.power \= 2;  
console.log(multiplyBy5(5));  
console.log(multiplyBy5.power);  
console.log(multiplyBy5.prototype);

function createUser(username, price) {  
 this.username \= username; //this sets current context  
 this.price \= price;  
}

createUser.prototype.increment \= function () {  
 this.price++;  
};

createUser.prototype.printMee \= function () {  
 console.log(\`price is ${this.price}\`);  
};  
const chai \= new createUser("chai", 25);  
const tea \= new createUser("tea", 250);

chai.printMee();  
chai.increment();

Here is what happens behind the scenes when the **new** keyword is used:

A new object is created: the new keyword initiates the creation of a new JavaScript object.

A prototype is linked: The newly created object gets linked to the prototype property of the  
constructor function. This means that it has access to properties and methods defined on the constructor's prototype.

The constructor is called: The constructor function is called with the specified arguments and this is bound to the newly  
created object. If no explicit return value is specified from the constructor. JavaScript assumes this, the newly  
created object, to be the intended return value.

The new object is returned: After the constructor function has been called, if it does not return a non-primitive  
value (object, array, function etc), the newly created object is returned.

**Nested Objects**  
An Object can contain other object as values.  
 let car \= {  
 Brand:”Maruti”,  
Year:2020,  
Owner: {  
 name:”Abhay”,  
Age: 20  
},  
};  
console.log(car.owner.name); //Output : Abhay

**‘this’ keyword**  
‘this’ keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function. It allows access to the object’s properties and methods from within the object.

**//Objects using this keyword to access properties**  
let person \= {  
name :”Abhay”,  
 age : 30,  
greet : function(){  
console.log(\`Hello, my name ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old\`);  
};  
}

person.greet(); //Output : Hello, my name is Abhay and I am 20 years old

Why use OOP

### Parts of OOP

**Object literal**  
Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or symbol) and each value can be of any data type, including other objects. Object literals provide simple and intuitive way to create objects directly in your code. It allows use to group related data and functionality together :

**//Object literal syntax**  
let persson \= {  
 name:”Abhay”,  
Age: 30,  
isStudent: false,  
greet: function(){  
 console.log(“Hello\!”);  
},  
};

**//Accessing Object Properties**  
console.log(person.name) //Output : Abhay  
console.log(person\[“name”\]) //Output : 30

**//Adding and Modifying Properties**  
person.location \= “Delhi”;  
Person.age \= 31;

**//Calling Object’s Method**  
person.greet() //Output : Hello\!

const user \= {  
 username: "hitesh",  
 loginCount: 8,  
 signedIn: true,  
 getUserDetail: function () {  
 //console.log("Got user details from database");  
 //console.log(\`UserName : ${this.username}\`);  
 console.log(this);  
 },  
};  
// console.log(user.loginCount);  
// console.log(user.getUserDetail());  
//console.log(this); // {}

function User(username, loginCount, isLoggedIn) {  
 this.username \= username;  
 this.loginCount \= loginCount;  
 this.isLoggedIn \= isLoggedIn;  
 this.greetings \= function () {  
 console.log(\`Welcome ${this.username}\`);  
 };  
 return this; //not mandatory to write this. JavaScript implicitly returns  
}

//new keyword generates a new empty object  
const userOne \= new User("Abhay", 12, true);  
const userTwo \= new User("Ajay", 8, true);  
console.log(userOne.constructor);  
console.log(userOne instanceof User); //return true  
// console.log(userTwo);  
//Prototypal inheritance

let myName \= "Abhay ";  
console.log(myName.length);

let myHeroes \= \["thor", "spiderman"\];

let heroPower \= {  
 thor: "hammer",  
 spiderman: "sling",  
 getSpiderPower: function () {  
 console.log(\`Spidy power is ${this.spiderman}\`);  
 },  
};

//added a new property in Object, now this is available in all objects/array  
Object.prototype.hitesh \= function () {  
 console.log(\`hitesh is present in all object\`);  
};  
heroPower.hitesh();  
myHeroes.hitesh();

Array.prototype.heyHitesh \= function () {  
 console.log(\`Hitesh says hello\`);  
};  
myHeroes.heyHitesh();  
//heroPower.heyHitesh(); heyHitesh is defined at array level, can't be accessed at object level

**Constructor function**  
A constructor function is a special type of function in JavaScript that is used to **create** and **initialise** objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating multiple objects with same structure and behaviour:

**//Constructor function for creating Person objects**  
function Person (name,age){  
 this.name \= name;  
 This.age \= age;

//Method to greet  
This.greet \= function(){  
 console.log(\`Hello, my name ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old\`);  
};  
}

//Creating new Person objects using the constructor function  
const personOne \= new Person(“Abhay”,20);  
const personTwo \= new Person(“Ajay”,30);

//Accessing object Properties  
console.log(personOne.name); //Output : Abhay  
console.log(personTwo.age); //Output : 30

//Calling Object Method  
personOne.greet(); //Output : Hello, my name is Abhay and I am 20 years old

**Prototype**  
In JavaScript, every object has a prototype. Think of a prototype as a **blueprint** or a **template**. When you create an object, JavaScript automatically gives it to the prototype. This **prototype is like a parent for your object** and it contains properties and methods that your object can use.

**//Lets create a simple object**  
let person \= {  
name :”Abhay”,  
 age : 30,  
greet : function(){  
console.log(\`Hello, my name ${this.name}\`);  
};  
}

**//Let’s create another object**  
let student= {  
major :”Computer Science”,  
}

**//We will set the prototype of student to person**  
Object.setPrototype(student,person);

**//Now, student inherits properties and methods from person**  
console.log(student.name); //Output : Abhay  
console.log(student.age); //Output : 30  
student.greet(); //Output : Hello, my name is Abhay

**//Lets add a property directly to the student object**  
student.location=”New York”

**//Now, let’s see if student has this property**  
console.log(student.location) //Output : “New York”

//Even though “location” is not defined in person, student can access it because of prototype inheritance

### Object Destructuring

Object destructuring allows you to extract properties from an object and assign them to variables.  
const person \= { name: 'John', age: 30, city: 'New York' };  
const { name, age, city } \= person;  
console.log(name); // John  
console.log(age); // 30  
console.log(city); // New York

You can **rename the variables** while destructuring.  
const person \= { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York" };  
const { name: personName, age: personAge } \= person; console.log(personName); // John  
console.log(personAge); // 30

You can **set default values** if the property does not exist in the object.  
const person \= { name: "John", age: 30 };  
const { name, age, city \= "Los Angeles" } \= person;  
console.log(city); // Los Angeles

**Destructuring a nested objects**.  
const person \= {  
name: "John",  
address: {  
city: "New York",  
country: "USA",  
},  
};  
const { name, address: { city, country }, } \= person;  
console.log(city); // New York  
console.log(country); // USA

**Object destructuring can be used directly in function parameters.**

function greet({ name, age }) {  
console.log(\`Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.\`);  
}

const person \= { name: "John", age: 30 };  
greet(person); // Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.

### Prototype chain

### Classes

Classes are a way to create objects in JavaScript. It provide more convenient and readable way to work with JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance system.

1. **Class declaration**

You can declare a class using the class keyword followed by the class name.  
   
class Car {  
 //Class methods and properties go here  
}

2.  **Constructor Method**  
     The constructor method is special method that gets called when you create a new instance of the class. It is used to initialise object properties.

        class Car {
        	constructor(brand,model){

    this.brand=brand;  
     this.model=model;  
    }  
    }

const myCar \= new Car(“Maruti”, “Swift”);  
console.log(myCar.brand); //Output : Maruti

3. **Class Methods**  
   You can define methods inside class, which are functions that can perform actions on class instances or return value.

class Car {  
 constructor(brand,model){  
 this.brand=brand;  
 this.model=model;  
}

drive(){  
 console.log(\`Driving ${this.brand} ${this.model}\`);  
}  
}

const myCar \= new Car(“Maruti”, “Swift”);  
myCar.drive(); //Output : Driving Maruti Swfit

4. **Inheritance**  
   You can create a subclass that inherits from parent class using **extends** keywords. The subclass can have its own **constructor and methods.** It can also **access the properties and methods of the parent class**. ‘**super()**’ allows you to access and execute the constructor of the parent class within the constructor of the subclass.

class ElectricCar extends Car {  
 constructor(brand,model, batteryCapacity){  
 super(brand,model);  
 this.batteryCapacity=batteryCapacity;  
}

charge(){  
 return \`${this.brand} is charging\`;  
}  
}

const myElectricCar \= new ElectricCar(“Maruti”, “Swift”,”100 kwh”);  
myCar.drive(); //Output : Driving Maruti Swfit  
console.log(myCar.charge()); //Output : Maruti is charging

**Instances (new, this)**

### Browser API

#### **Local Storage**

Local storage is a handy feature in web browsers that allows you to store data persistently on a user's device. It's like having a little storage space within the browser where you can keep information even when the user closes the tab or refreshes the page.

- **Local Storage Basics**: Storing Data: You can save data in the form of key-value pairs. Data Persistence: Data stored in local storage remains even after the browser is closed and reopened. Access: You can access local storage data from any page within the same domain.  

- **Setting Data**: localStorage.setItem("username", "john_doe");  

- **Getting Data**: let username \= localStorage.getItem("username"); console.log(username); // Output: john_doe  

- **Removing Data**: localStorage.removeItem("username"); localStorage.clear(); // Clear all data from local storage

#### **Fetch API**

The Fetch API is a modern, promise-based way to make asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript. It provides a more powerful and flexible feature set compared to the older XMLHttpRequest (XHR) API. To use the Fetch API, you call the fetch function with the URL you want to request, optionally passing in options such as HTTP method, headers, and body.

**// Basic Syntax**  
fetch(url, options)  
.then((response) \=\> {  
// Handle response  
}) .catch((error) \=\> {  
 // Handle error  
});

**//example** // Define the URL of the API endpoint  
const url \= "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";  
// Use fetch to get data from the API  
fetch(url)  
 .then((response) \=\> {  
if (\!response.ok) {  
throw new Error("Network response was not ok " \+ response.statusText);  
}  
return response.json();  
// Parse the JSON from the response  
}) .then((data) \=\> {  
console.log("Do something...");  
return data;  
})  
.then((data) \=\> {  
console.log("data from the API:");  
console.log(data);  
 })  
.catch((error) \=\> {  
console.error("There has been a problem with your fetch operation:", error);  
});

#### **Fetch API (Advanced Usage)**

You can also specify additional options like HTTP methods, headers, and request body:  
const url \= "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";  
const options \= {  
method: "POST",  
headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json", },  
body: JSON.stringify({  
title: "foo",  
body: "bar",  
userId: 1,  
}),  
};  
fetch(url, options)  
 .then((response) \=\> response.json())  
 .then((data) \=\> console.log(data))  
.catch((error) \=\> console.error("Error:", error));

In this example:

- **Method**: POST to send data.
- **Headers**: Content-Type set to application/json indicating that the request body contains JSON.
- **Body**: The actual data being sent, converted to a JSON string.

**HTTP Methods**

| Method  | Description                                                    | Use Case                                          | Idempotent | Safe |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------- | :--- |
| GET     | Retrieves data from the server                                 | Fetching Data                                     | Yes        | Yes  |

**Headers**  
Headers are a crucial part of HTTP requests and responses. They carry information about the request or response, such as the content type, authorization tokens, and other metadata. Here’s a table summarizing the popular and important HTTP header fields:

- **Content-Type**: Indicates the media type of the resource (e.g., application/json, text/html).
- **Authorization**: Contains credentials for authenticating the client to the server (e.g., Bearer token).
- **Accept**: Informs the server about the types of data the client can process (e.g., application/json).
- **User-Agent**: Contains information about the user agent (client) originating the request.
- **Cache-Control**: Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses.
- **Cookie**: Contains stored HTTP cookies previously sent by the server with the Set-Cookie header.
- **X-Custom-Header**: Custom headers for specific use cases.

**Creating Headers**  
You can create a Headers object in several ways:

1. **Empty Headers Object**:  
   const headers \= new Headers();  

2. **With Initial Headers**: const headers \= new Headers({ "Content-Type": "application/json", Authorization: "Bearer token123", });  

3. **From Another Headers Object**: const existingHeaders \= new Headers({ "Content-Type": "application/json", }); const headers \= new Headers(existingHeaders);

**Common Headers Methods**  
The Headers interface provides several methods to interact with the headers:

1. **append**: Adds a new value to an existing header (does not overwrite). headers.append("X-Custom-Header", "value1"); headers.append("X-Custom-Header", "value2"); // Adds another value under the same header name
2. **set**: Sets a new header or updates the value of an existing header. headers.set("Content-Type", "application/json");
3. **get**: Retrieves the value of a header.  
   console.log(headers.get("Content-Type")); // Outputs: application/json
4. **has**: Checks if a header exists.  
   console.log(headers.has("Content-Type")); // Outputs: true
5. **delete**: Removes a header.  
   headers.delete("X-Custom-Header");
6. **entries**: Returns an iterator allowing you to go through all key/value pairs in the headers.  
   for (const \[key, value\] of headers.entries()) {  
   console.log(\`${key}: ${value}\`);  
   }
7. **keys**: Returns an iterator allowing you to go through all the keys.  
   for (const key of headers.keys()) {

   console.log(key);  
   }

8. **values**: Returns an iterator allowing you to go through all the values.  
   for (const value of headers.values()) {  
   console.log(value);  
   }

**Body**  
The body of an HTTP message contains the data being sent. It is optional and usually present in methods that need to send data.

- **Body.bodyUsed :** A boolean value indicating whether the body has been consumed (read) already. It's false by default.
- **Body.body :** Represents the body of the request or response as a ReadableStream. A ReadableStream is an interface for handling streaming data.
- **Body.arrayBuffer():** Returns a promise that resolves with an ArrayBuffer containing the body content.
- **Body.blob():** Returns a promise that resolves with a Blob containing the body content.
- **Body.json() :** Parses the body content as JSON. Returns a promise that resolves with the parsed JSON data.
- **Body.text():** Reads the body content as text. Returns a promise that resolves with the body content as a string

When you make a request using the Fetch API, you can access the Body interface from the Response object returned by the fetch() call. Similarly, when you create a request using fetch(), you can specify the body content using the body option.

**// Accessing Response Body**  
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")  
.then((response) \=\> {  
// Check if response is OK  
if (\!response.ok) {  
throw new Error("Network response was not ok");  
} // Parse JSON body  
return response.json();  
 })  
 .then((data) \=\> {  
console.log(data); // Process the parsed JSON data  
})  
.catch((error) \=\> {  
console.error("There was a problem with the fetch operation:", error);  
});

**// Sending Request Body**  
const url \= "https://api.example.com/data";  
const options \= {  
 method: "POST",  
headers: {  
"Content-Type": "application/json",  
},  
body: JSON.stringify({  
key: "value"  
}),  
};

fetch(url, options)  
.then((response) \=\> response.json())  
.then((data) \=\> console.log(data))  
 .catch((error) \=\> console.error("Error:", error));

## Chapter 7 : DSA {#chapter-7-:-dsa}

### MAP {#map}

A Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys.

**//declare a map**  
const mapOne \= new Map();

**//set value in map**  
mapOne.set('a',1);  
mapOne.set('b',2);  
mapOne.set('c',3);

**//access value from map**  
console.log(mapOne.get('a'));  
console.log(mapOne.get('b'));  
console.log(mapOne.get('c'));

**//size of map**  
console.log('size : ', mapOne.size);

**//delete key/value from map**  
mapOne.delete('a');

**//size of map**  
console.log('size after delete : ',mapOne.size);

//ToDo  
// difference between map and object

### WeakMap

A WeakMap object is a collection of key-value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced, meaning they can be garbage collected if there are no other references to the object.

const weakMap \= new WeakMap();  
let obj \= {};  
weakMap.set(obj, 'value');  
obj \= null; **// Now the entry in the WeakMap can be garbage collected**

### SET {#set}

A Set object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references.  
**//declare set**  
const set \= new Set(\[1, 2, 3, 4, 4\]);  
console.log(set); // Output: Set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }

### WeakSet

A WeakSet is similar to a Set, but its values must be objects, and those objects are held weakly.  
const weakSet \= new WeakSet();  
let obj \= {};  
weakSet.add(obj);  
obj \= null; **// Now the entry in the WeakSet can be garbage collected**

const unique \= letters.filter((letter,index)=\>{  
 return letters.indexOf(letter)===index;  
})  
console.log(unique)  
\`\`\`

\`Output :\`

\- \[ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f' \]

### Remove duplicates from an array of objects by one property {#remove-duplicates-from-an-array-of-objects-by-one-property}

const members \= \[  
 { id: 1, name: 'John' },  
 { id: 2, name: 'Jane' },  
 { id: 1, name: 'Johnny' },  
 { id: 4, name: 'Alice' },  
\];  
const unique \= \[...new Map(members.map((m) \=\> \[m.id, m\])).values()\];  
console.log(unique)

**Output :**  
 **\[**  
 **{ id: 1, name: 'Johnny' },**  
 **{ id: 2, name: 'Jane' },**  
 **{ id: 4, name: 'Alice' }**  
 **\]**

**How it works**

- Create a new array from the original array using map() method

\`members.map((m) \=\> \[m.id, m\])\`

- It returns an array of arrays. Each nested array contains the value of the id and the corresponding object:

  \[

  \[ 1, { id: 1, name: 'John' } \],

  \[ 2, { id: 2, name: 'Jane' } \],

  \[ 1, { id: 1, name: 'Johnny' } \],

  \[ 4, { id: 4, name: 'Alice' } \]

  \]

\- Second, remove the duplicate by creating a new Map() object:

\`\`\`  
const newMap \= new Map(newArray);  
\`\`\`

\- Because the keys of a Map object are unique, creating a Map from the array of array removes the duplicate object by  
 key (id in this case).

\`\`\`dotnetcli  
const iterator \= newMap.values();  
console.log(iterator);  
\[Map Iterator\] {  
 { id: 1, name: 'Johnny' },  
 { id: 2, name: 'Jane' },  
 { id: 4, name: 'Alice' }  
}  
\`\`\`

### Sum of array elements {#sum-of-array-elements}

const numbers \= \[1, 3, 4, 5, 6\];  
const sum \= numbers.reduce((sum, curr) \=\> sum \+ curr, 0);  
console.log(sum);

### Largest/Smallest number in array {#largest/smallest-number-in-array}

const numbers \= \[1, 3, 4, 5, 6\];  
console.log(Math.max(...numbers));// 6  
console.log(Math.min(...numbers)); // 1

### Remove All Whitespace from a String in JavaScript {#remove-all-whitespace-from-a-string-in-javascript}

To remove all whitespace from a string in JavaScript, call the replace() method on the string, passing a regular expression that matches any whitespace character, and an empty string as a replacement. For example, str.replace(/\\s/g, '') returns a new string with all whitespace removed from str. he \\s regex metacharacter matches whitespace characters, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines.

We use the g regex flag to specify that all whitespace characters in the string should be matched. Without this flag, only the first whitespace will be matched and replaced:

const str \= '1 2 3';  
const whitespaceRemoved \= str.replace(/\\s/g, '');  
console.log(whitespaceRemoved); // 123

### Is Object/Array empty {#is-object/array-empty}

Given an object or an array, return if it is empty.

- An empty object contains no key-value pairs.
- An empty array contains no elements.

  let obj \= {};

  let array \= \[\];

  function isEmpty(obj) {

  if (typeof obj \=== "object" && \!Array.isArray(obj)) {

      return Object.keys(obj).length \=== 0;

  }

  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {

      return obj.length \=== 0;

  }

  return false;

  }

  console.log(isEmpty(obj)); **// true**

  console.log(isEmpty(array)); **// true**

  obj \= {"x": 5, "y": 42};

  array \= \[1,2\];

  console.log(isEmpty(obj)); **// false**

  console.log(isEmpty(array)); **// false**

### Flatten Deeply Nested Array {#flatten-deeply-nested-array}

Conversion of that array with some or all of the sub-arrays removed and replaced with the actual elements in that sub-array. This flattening operation should only be done if the current depth of nesting is less than n. The depth of the elements in the first array are considered to be 0\.

Please solve it without the built-in Array.flat method.

**Example 1:**  
**Input:**  
arr \= \[1, 2, 3, \[4, 5, 6\], \[7, 8, \[9, 10, 11\], 12\], \[13, 14, 15\]\]  
n \= 0  
**Output:**  
\[1, 2, 3, \[4, 5, 6\], \[7, 8, \[9, 10, 11\], 12\], \[13, 14, 15\]\]

**Explanation**  
Passing a depth of n=0 will always result in the original array. This is because the smallest possible depth of a subarray (0) is not less than n=0. Thus, no subarray should be flattened.  
Example 2:

**Input:**  
arr \= \[1, 2, 3, \[4, 5, 6\], \[7, 8, \[9, 10, 11\], 12\], \[13, 14, 15\]\]  
n \= 1  
**Output:**  
\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, \[9, 10, 11\], 12, 13, 14, 15\]

**Explanation**  
The subarrays starting with 4, 7, and 13 are all flattened. This is because their depth of 0 is less than 1\. However \[9, 10, 11\] remains unflattened because its depth is 1\.  
**Example 3:**  
**Input:**  
arr \= \[\[1, 2, 3\], \[4, 5, 6\], \[7, 8, \[9, 10, 11\], 12\], \[13, 14, 15\]\]  
n \= 2  
**Output:**  
\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\]

**Explanation**  
The maximum depth of any subarray is 1\. Thus, all of them are flattened.

**Solution:**  
var flat \= function (arr, n) {  
 return arr.flat(n);  
};  
console.log(flat(arr, 0));  
console.log(flat(arr, 1));  
console.log(flat(arr, 2));

### **Join Two Arrays by ID** {#join-two-arrays-by-id}

Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, return a new array joinedArray. All the objects in each of the two inputs arrays will contain an id field that has an integer value.

joinedArray is an array formed by merging arr1 and arr2 based on their id key. The length of joinedArray should be the length of unique values of id. The returned array should be sorted in ascending order based on the id key.

If a given id exists in one array but not the other, the single object with that id should be included in the result array without modification.

If two objects share an id, their properties should be merged into a single object:

If a key only exists in one object, that single key-value pair should be included in the object.  
If a key is included in both objects, the value in the object from arr2 should override the value from arr1.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**  
arr1 \= \[  
 {"id": 1, "x": 1},  
 {"id": 2, "x": 9}  
\],  
arr2 \= \[  
 {"id": 3, "x": 5}  
\]  
**Output:**  
\[  
 {"id": 1, "x": 1},  
 {"id": 2, "x": 9},  
 {"id": 3, "x": 5}  
\]

**Explanation**: There are no duplicate ids so arr1 is simply concatenated with arr2.  
**Example 2**:

**Input:**  
arr1 \= \[  
 {"id": 1, "x": 2, "y": 3},  
 {"id": 2, "x": 3, "y": 6}  
\],  
arr2 \= \[  
 {"id": 2, "x": 10, "y": 20},  
 {"id": 3, "x": 0, "y": 0}  
\]  
Output:  
\[  
 {"id": 1, "x": 2, "y": 3},  
 {"id": 2, "x": 10, "y": 20},  
 {"id": 3, "x": 0, "y": 0}  
\]  
**Explanation:** The two objects with id=1 and id=3 are included in the result array without modification. The two objects with id=2 are merged together. The keys from arr2 override the values in arr1.  
Example 3:

**Input**:  
arr1 \= \[  
 {"id": 1, "b": {"b": 94},"v": \[4, 3\], "y": 48}  
\]  
arr2 \= \[  
 {"id": 1, "b": {"c": 84}, "v": \[1, 3\]}  
\]  
Output: \[  
 {"id": 1, "b": {"c": 84}, "v": \[1, 3\], "y": 48}  
\]

**Explanation**: The two objects with id=1 are merged together. For the keys "b" and "v" the values from arr2 are used. Since the key "y" only exists in arr1, that value is taken from arr1.

**Solution :**  
_var join \= function (arr1, arr2) {_  
 _var obj \= {};_  
 **_//adding 1st array in object_**  
 _for (let a of arr1) {_  
 _obj\[a.id\] \= a;_  
 _}_

**_//adding 2nd array in object_**  
 _for (let b of arr2) {_  
 _if (obj\[b.id\]) {_  
 **_//if id already exists_**  
 _for (const key in b) {_  
 **_//replace existing key by key in 2nd array_**  
 _obj\[b.id\]\[key\] \= b\[key\];_  
 _}_  
 _} else {_  
 **_//add in object_**  
 _obj\[b.id\] \= b;_  
 _}_  
 _}_  
_};_

### Read JSON File using JavaScript {#read-json-file-using-javascript}

JSON also known as JavaScript Object Notation is a basic or standardised design used for the transportation and storage of data. It is a plain text written in JavaScript Object Notation which is language-independent. It is a lightweight data-interchange format. JSON is a self-describing format and it is easy to understand. JSON consists of two primary structures:

1. **Object :** An unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in **curly braces**. Each key is a string followed by a **colon** and its corresponding value. Keys and values are separated by **commas**. Keys must be unique within an object.  
   {

   "name": "John",  
   "age": 30,  
   "city": "New York"  
   }

2. **Array :** An ordered collection of values enclosed in **square brackets**. Values can be of any data type, including objects, arrays, strings, numbers, Booleans, or null. Values in an array are **separated by commas**.

   \["apple", "banana", "orange"\];

**Parsing JSON**  
Parsing JSON is the process of converting a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) string into a JavaScript object that you can work with in your code. JavaScript provides a built-in method called "**JSON.parse()**" to parse JSON strings. It takes a JSON string as input and returns a JavaScript object.

const jsonString \= '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}';

**//Parsing JSON string to JavaScript object**  
const jsonObject \= JSON.parse(jsonString);  
console.log(jsonObject.name); //Output: John  
console.log(jsonObject.age); //Output:30  
console.log(jsonObject.city); // Output: New York  
**Handling Nested Objects and Arrays**  
JSON can represent complex data structures with nested objects and arrays. JSON.parse() handles nested structures seamlessly.

const jsonString \= '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "address": {"city": "New York", "zipcode": "10001"}, "hobbies": \["Reading", "Traveling"\]}';

const jsonObject \= JSON.parse(jsonString);

console.log(jsonObject.address.city); // Output: New York console.log(jsonObject.hobbies\[0\]); // Output: Reading

**Handling Invalid JSON**  
JSON.parse() throws an error if the JSON string is invalid.

const invalidJsonString \= '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York",}'; // Note the trailing comma after "New York"

try {  
const jsonObject \= JSON.parse(invalidJsonString);  
console.log(jsonObject);  
} catch (error) {  
console.error("Error parsing JSON:", error.message); // Error parsing JSON: Expected double-quoted property name in JSON at position 47  
}

**Stringifying objects to JSON**  
Stringifying objects to JSON is the process of converting a JavaScript object into a JSON string. JavaScript provides a builtin method called "**JSON.stringify()**" that converts JavaScript objects into JSON strings.  
const person \= { name: "John", age: 30, city: "New York", };  
const jsonString \= JSON.stringify(person);  
console.log(jsonString);  
**// output:** {"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York"}

**JSON.stringify()** can handle nested objects and arrays as well. It recursively converts all the properties of an object into JSON format.  
const data \= {  
name: "John",  
age: 30,  
city: "New York",  
hobbies: \["Reading", "Traveling"\],  
address: { street: "123 Main St", zip: "10001", },  
};

const jsonString \= JSON.stringify(data);  
console.log(jsonString);  
**// output** : {"name":"John","age":30,"city":"New York","hobbies":\["Reading","Traveling"\],"address":{"street":"123 Main St","zip":"10001"}}

We can read JSON files in JavaScript using the following methods:

**Method 1\. Using Required Module\*\***

const dataJson \= require('config.json');  
console.log(typeof dataJson);  
console.log(dataJson);

**Method 2\. Using ES6 Import Module (Web Runtime Environment)**

import dataJson from 'config.json';  
document.getElementById('main').innerHTML \= JSON.stringify(dataJson);

\#\#\# Install following package

\`\`\`  
 "pg": "^8.8.0",  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Create a JS file like queries.js and Add following import statement

\`\`\`  
const { response, request } \= require("express");  
require("log-timestamp");  
const Pool \= require("pg").Pool;  
var types \= require("pg").types;  
const ping \= require("ping");  
const { deviceDetails } \= require("./DeviceList");  
//var Ping \= require("ping-lite");  
const momenttimezone \= require("moment-timezone");  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Create Connection With PostGresSQL DB

\`\`\`  
const pool \= new Pool({  
 user: "testloguser", //login user  
 host: "localhost",  
 database: "testlog", //database name  
 password: "testloguser", // password  
 port: 5432,//port where postgres is running  
});  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Get Data from postgres table

\`\`\`  
const getDefectList \= (request, response) \=\> {  
 try {  
 let queryString \="select \* from defects"; //make sure defects table exists in your database  
 pool.query(queryString, (error, results) \=\> {  
 if (error) {  
 throw error;  
 }  
 response.status(200).json(results.rows);  
 });  
 } catch (error) {  
 console.log(error);  
 }  
};  
\`\`\`

\#\#\# Export above created function, so that you could import in other JS file

## Chapter 9 : Miscellaneous {#chapter-9-:-miscellaneous}

### Rest syntax or Rest Operator {#rest-syntax-or-rest-operator}

The rest operator (…) allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It is often used in function parameters to capture all remaining arguments into a single array.

1. **Function Parameters**  
   function sum(...args) {

   return args.reduce((acc, curr) \=\> acc \+ curr, 0);

   }  
   console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // **Output**: 10  


2. **Destructuring Arrays**  
   const \[first, second, ...rest\] \= \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\];  
   console.log(first); // Output: 1  
   console.log(second); // Output: 2  
   console.log(rest); // Output: \[3, 4, 5\]  

3. **Destructuring Objects**  
   const { a, b, ...rest } \= { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 };  
   console.log(a); // Output: 1  
   console.log(b); // Output: 2  
   console.log(rest); // Output: { c: 3, d: 4 }

#### **Array Destructuring using rest syntax** {#array-destructuring-using-rest-syntax}

Array destructuring is flexible. It uses less space, and even allows you to ignore values. You can even get the remaining elements as a new array. Instead of accessing elements individually, one by one, you can get multiple at once.

const kidsName \= \["Govind","Gopal","Pari","Kanhu","Aayu"\]

**//traditional way of accessing array values**  
const firstValue \= kidsName\[0\];  
const secondValue \= kidsName\[1\];  
console.log(firstValue);  
console.log(secondValue);

    **//Using rest syntax**

const \[firstValue, ,thirdValue, ...rest\] \= kidsName

console.log(firstValue); **//Govind**  
console.log(thirdValue); **//Pari**  
console.log(rest); **//\[ 'Kanhu', 'Aayu' \]**

**Output**:  
Govind  
Pari  
\[ 'Kanhu', 'Aayu' \]

**Receiving Data using rest syntax**

A rest parameter is a special kind of parameter that receives all remaining arguments of a function call via array.

function myFunc(first, ...remaining) {  
 return {first, remaining}  
}

console.log(myFunc(1,2,3)) **//{ first: 1, remaining: \[ 2, 3 \] }**

\`Output:\`  
{ first: 1, remaining: \[ 2, 3 \] }

**Object Destructuring using rest syntax**  
const {first:f, ...remaining} \= {first:'Kanhu', last:'Pari', age:5}

console.log(f)  
console.log(remaining)

**Output:**  
Kanhu  
{ last: 'Pari', age: 5 }

### Spreading data using Spread operator

Spreading into a function call turns Array elements into function call arguments. The spread operator (…) allows an iterable such as an array or object to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected. The spread operator (...) in JavaScript allows you to easily create a new array by combining elements from an existing array with additional elements.

function returnArgArray(...args){  
 return args  
}

returnArgArray(...\[1,2,3\])

console.log(returnArgArray(...\[1,2,3\]))  
\`Output:\`  
\[ 1, 2, 3 \]

**Spread arrays into Array literals**  
console.log(returnArgArray(...\[1,2,3\],4))  
\`Output:\`

1. **Copying Arrays**  
   const arr1 \= \[1, 2, 3\];  
   const arr2 \= \[...arr1\]; // Creates a shallow copy of arr1  
   console.log(arr2); // **Output**: \[1, 2, 3\]  

2. **Combining Arrays**  
   const arr1 \= \[1, 2, 3\];  
   const arr2 \= \[4, 5, 6\];  
   const combined \= \[...arr1, ...arr2\];  
   console.log(combined); // **Output**: \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\]  

3. **Spreading Elements in Function Calls**  
   function sum(a, b, c) {

   return a \+ b \+ c;  
   }  
   const numbers \= \[1, 2, 3\];  
   console.log(sum(...numbers)); // **Output**: 6  


4. **Copying Objects**  
   const obj1 \= { a: 1, b: 2 };

   const obj2 \= { ...obj1 }; // Creates a shallow copy of obj1 console.log(obj2); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2 }  


5. **Combining Objects**  
   const obj1 \= { a: 1, b: 2 };  
   const obj2 \= { c: 3, d: 4 };  
   const combined \= { ...obj1, ...obj2 };  
   console.log(combined); // **Output**: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }

### **Significance of ^ and \~ symbols mentioned in the package.json file for the package version** {#significance-of-^-and-~-symbols-mentioned-in-the-package.json-file-for-the-package-version}

Whenever we install any npm package, a new entry is added in the dependencies or devDependencies section of the  
package.json file in the following format:

\`\`\`  
"dependencies": {  
"axios": "^0.24.0"  
}  
\`\`\`

The version number 0.24.0 is a combination of 3 digits separated by the dot operator. Let’s say the version is a.b.c

\<ol\>  
\<ul\>First value (a in a.b.c) specifies the major version of the package \- It means this version has Major code changes and it might contain breaking API changes.\</ul\>  
\<ul\>Second value (b in a.b.c) specifies the minor version which contains minor changes but will not contain breaking API changes.\</ul\>  
\<ul\>Third value (c in a.b.c) specifies the patch version which usually contains bug fixes.\</ul\>  
\</ol\>

\`^\` : This symbol means when we want to update all the packages mentioned in package.json, using npm update, it will  
update to only patch and minor released version.

So if your current version is 0.24.0 and there is a minor version released so the package will be updated to 0.25.0.

If there is only a patch version released then it will be updated to the latest available patch version like 0.24.1.

\`\~\`: This symbol means the package will be updated to only patch releases when we run the npm update command i.e only  
the last digit so from 0.24.0 to 0.24.1 or 0.24.2 but not 0.25.0 or 1.24.0

If there is no symbol like "axios": "0.24.0" then exact same version will be installed after running the npm update  
command.

You can also update the specific npm package by adding the package name after the npm update command gitlike this: npm  
update axios.

### **Fetch Data from API** {#fetch-data-from-api}

\#\# Different ways to fetch data from API

\- using \*\*fetch\*\* API  
 This method accept URI to the data. To do this, first create a function fetchData(), it will call fetch() method with  
 provided URL, then convert the result to JSON Object.

\`\`\`  
 const fetchData \= () \=\>{  
 return fetch("https://api.agify.io/?name=bella")  
 .then((response)=\>response.json())  
 .then((response)=\>console.log(response))  
 .catch(err \=\> console.error(err));  
 }

fetchData() //call function  
 \`\`\`

\`Output: \`  
 {name: 'bella', age: 35, count: 40138}

\`Failure response : Failed to fetch at \\\_app-c265dce31871f367.js:1:752592 at fetchData (\<anonymous\>:2:10) at \<anonymous\>:7:1 \`

:::tip You can specify header info also

\`\`\`  
const options \= {  
 method: 'GET',  
 headers: {  
 'X-RapidAPI-Host': 'alpha-vantage.p.rapidapi.com',  
 'X-RapidAPI-Key': 'SIGN-UP-FOR-KEY'  
 }  
};

const fetchData \= () \=\>{  
 return fetch("https://api.agify.io/?name=bella", options)  
 .then((response)=\>response.json())  
 .then((response)=\>console.log(response))  
 .catch(err \=\> console.error(err));  
 }

‘==’ operator is also known as the loose equality operator which is mainly used to compare two values on both sides and then return true or false. This operator checks equality only after converting both the values to a common type i.e _type coercion_.

‘**\===**’ operator is also known as strict equality operator, it compares both the value and the type which is why the name “strict equality”. When you do not want automatic type conversion to be applied, use \=== operator.

**Note** : It is advised to use ‘===’ operator for comparing equality of two values.

### How do you check type of a variable in JavaScript {#how-do-you-check-type-of-a-variable-in-javascript}

In JavaScript, you can check the type of a variable using several methods, depending on what you need to determine. Here are the most common ways to check the type of a variable:

### **`typeof` Operator** {#typeof-operator}

The `typeof` operator is the most commonly used method to check the type of a variable. It returns a string indicating the type of the operand.  
console.log(typeof 42); // "number"  
console.log(typeof 'hello'); // "string"  
console.log(typeof true); // "boolean"  
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"  
console.log(typeof null); // "object" (this is a known quirk in JavaScript) console.log(typeof {}); // "object"  
console.log(typeof \[\]); // "object" (arrays are objects)  
console.log(typeof function() {}); // "function"

### **`instanceof` Operator** {#instanceof-operator}

The `instanceof` operator checks whether an object is an instance of a specific constructor or class.  
console.log(\[\] instanceof Array); // true  
console.log({} instanceof Object); // true  
console.log(function() {} instanceof Function); // true  
console.log(new Date() instanceof Date); // true

### **`Array.isArray` Method** {#array.isarray-method}

To check if a variable is an array, you can use the `Array.isArray` method.  
_console.log(Array.isArray(\[\])); // true_  
_console.log(Array.isArray({})); // false_

### **`Object.prototype.toString.call`** {#object.prototype.tostring.call}

For a more accurate type check, especially for distinguishing between objects, arrays, null, and other types, you can use `Object.prototype.toString.call`.

console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(42)); // "\[object Number\]"  
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call('hello'));// "\[object String\]"  
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(true)); // "\[object Boolean\]"  
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(undefined));// "\[object Undefined\]"  
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(null)); // "\[object Null\]"  
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call({})); // "\[object Object\]"  
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(\[\]));// "\[object Array\]"  
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(function() {})); // "\[object Function\]"  
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(new Date())); // "\[object Date\]"

### **`constructor` Property** {#constructor-property}

You can also check the constructor property of an object to determine its type.

console.log((42).constructor \=== Number); **// true**  
console.log('hello'.constructor \=== String); **// true**  
console.log(true.constructor \=== Boolean); **// true**  
console.log(({}).constructor \=== Object); **// true**  
console.log(\[\].constructor \=== Array); **// true**  
console.log((function() {}).constructor \=== Function); **// true**  
console.log((new Date()).constructor \=== Date); **// true**

### Explain the difference between function declaration and function expression {#explain-the-difference-between-function-declaration-and-function-expression}

### Why are functions in JavaScript called First-Class functions? {#why-are-functions-in-javascript-called-first-class-functions?}

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens. This means they are treated like any other variable. You can :

- Assign functions to variables.
- Pass functions as arguments to other functions.
- Return functions from other functions.

Why Are First-Class Functions Important?

- **Flexibility**: Enables powerful patterns like higher-order functions and callbacks.
- **Modularity**: Promotes writing smaller, reusable functions.
- **Expressiveness**: Enhances the expressive power of the language, making it easier to write concise and readable code.

**Practical Use Case** :

First-class functions shine in scenarios like event handling, callbacks, and functional programming paradigms.

### What is the Spread and Rest Operator?

The spread operator (...) and the rest operator (...) in JavaScript both use the same syntax (...), but they serve different purposes depending on where and how they are used.

**Spread Operator**:

- **Purpose**: The spread operator is used to expand or "spread out" elements of an iterable (like an array, string, or object) into individual elements.
- **Usage**: The spread operator is typically used in places where multiple elements or values are expected, such as function arguments, array literals, or object literals.
- Expands an array or object into its individual elements or properties. const arr \= \[1, 2, 3\];  
  console.log(...arr); // Output: 1 2 3
- The spread operator is used **where values are expected to be expanded**. Example \-

  In function calls: `myFunction(...args)`

  In array literals: `[...array]`

  In object literals: `{...object}`

**Examples**:

**In Arrays**:

const arr1 \= \[1, 2, 3\];  
const arr2 \= \[...arr1, 4, 5\];  
console.log(arr2); // Output: \[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]

Note : Here, `...arr1` spreads out the elements of `arr1` into `arr2`

**`In Function Arguments`**`:`  
`function sum(a, b, c) {`  
 `return a + b + c;`  
`}`

`const numbers = [1, 2, 3];`  
`console.log(sum(...numbers)); // Output: 6`

`Note : The spread operator spreads the array numbers into individual arguments for the sum function.`

**`In Objects`**`:`  
`const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };`  
`const obj2 = { ...obj1, c: 3 };`  
`console.log(obj2); // Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }`

`Here, ...obj1 spreads out the properties of obj1 into obj2.`

**Rest Operator**:

- **Purpose**: The rest operator is used to collect multiple elements or values into a single array or object. It is typically used to handle an arbitrary number of arguments in a function or to gather remaining elements of an array or properties of an object.
- **Usage**: The rest operator is used in function parameters and destructuring assignments to bundle values into an array or object.
- Collects multiple elements into a single array or object. Example \-

  function collectArgs(...args) {

  console.log(args);

  }

  collectArgs(1, 2, 3); // Output: \[1, 2, 3\]

- The rest operator is used **where values are expected to be collected** into a single array or object.

  In function parameters: `function(...args) { ... }`

  In array destructuring: `[first, ...rest]`

  In object destructuring: `const {a, ...rest} = obj;`

**Examples**:

**In Function Parameters**:  
function sumAll(...numbers) {  
 return numbers.reduce((total, number) \=\> total \+ number, 0);  
}

console.log(sumAll(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Output: 10

Note : The rest operator `...numbers` gathers all passed arguments into an array named `numbers`.

**In Destructuring**:  
const \[first, ...rest\] \= \[10, 20, 30, 40\];  
console.log(first); // Output: 10  
console.log(rest); // Output: \[20, 30, 40\]  
Note : Here, `first` gets the first element, and `...rest` collects the remaining elements into an array.

### What is Promise? How to resolve a bunch of Promises in order?

Promises in JavaScript are a powerful tool for handling asynchronous operations. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never, and they help manage asynchronous code in a more manageable and readable way compared to traditional callback functions.

### **Usage**

1. **Asynchronous Operations**:
   - Promises are primarily used to handle asynchronous operations like fetching data from a server, reading files, or waiting for a timer. Instead of blocking the execution of the code, promises allow the program to continue running while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.
2. **Avoiding Callback Hell**:
   - Promises help avoid "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom," where multiple nested callbacks make the code difficult to read and maintain. With promises, you can chain `.then()` and `.catch()` methods, leading to cleaner, more linear code.
3. **Chaining Operations**:
   - Promises allow for chaining multiple asynchronous operations in a sequence. Each `.then()` method can return a new promise, which the next `.then()` will wait for before executing. This makes it easier to manage sequences of operations that depend on the results of previous ones.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Promises provide a cleaner way to handle errors in asynchronous code. You can use the `.catch()` method to handle any errors that occur during the execution of the promise, rather than handling errors in each callback function.
5. **Parallel Execution**:
   - With `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`, you can manage multiple asynchronous operations that run in parallel. `Promise.all()` waits for all promises to resolve, while `Promise.race()` returns the result of the first promise that resolves or rejects.

A promise can be in one of three states:

- **Pending**: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled**: The operation was completed successfully.
- **Rejected**: The operation failed.

  const myPromise \= new Promise((resolve, reject) \=\> {

  const success \= true; // Simulate a condition

  if (success) {

      resolve("The operation was successful\!");

  } else {

      reject("The operation failed.");

  }

  });

  **// Handling the promise**

  myPromise

  .then(result \=\> {

      console.log(result); // If the promise is resolved

  })

  .catch(error \=\> {

      console.error(error); // If the promise is rejected

  });

  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')

  .then(response \=\> response.json())

  .then(data \=\> console.log(data))

  .catch(error \=\> console.error('Error:', error));

  **Handling Multiple Promises in Parallel**

  const promise1 \= fetch('https://api.example.com/data1');

  const promise2 \= fetch('https://api.example.com/data2');

  Promise.all(\[promise1, promise2\])

  .then(results \=\> {

      // Both promises have resolved

      const data1 \= results\[0\];

      const data2 \= results\[1\];

      console.log('Data 1:', data1);

      console.log('Data 2:', data2);

  })

  .catch(error \=\> console.error('Error:', error));

  `Promise.all()` waits for all promises in the array to resolve. This is useful when you need to perform multiple asynchronous tasks simultaneously and only proceed when all are complete.

### Explain the concept of Object Destructuring in JavaScript {#explain-the-concept-of-object-destructuring-in-javascript}

### What is the difference between null and undefined? {#what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined?}

null and undefined represent the absence of a value, but they are used in different contexts and have distinct differences.

**undefined**

1. **Type**: `undefined` is a primitive type in JavaScript.  
   Example \- console.log(typeof undefined); **// Output: "undefined"**

2. **Default Value**: Variables that are declared but not initialised are automatically assigned the value `undefined`. Example \-

   let useName;

   console.log(useName); **// Output: undefined**

3. **Unassigned Variables**: If you declare a variable but do not assign it a value, it is `undefined`. Example \-

   let useName;

   console.log(useName); **// Output: undefined**

4. **Function Return Value**: If a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns `undefined`. Example \-  
   function greet() { console.log('Hello'); } console.log(greet());  
   **// Output: Hello, followed by undefined**  

5. **Object Properties**: If you try to access a property that does not exist on an object, you will get `undefined`. Example \-  
   let obj \= { name: 'Abhay' };  
   console.log(obj.age); // **Output: undefined**  

6. **Function Parameters**: If a function is called with fewer arguments than it is defined to accept, the missing arguments are `undefined`. Example \-  
   function add(x, y) { return x \+ y; }  
   console.log(add(5));  
   **// Output: NaN (because y is undefined and 5 \+ undefined is NaN)**  

7. It is used to check if a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

8. It is a falsy value, which means evaluate to false in a boolean context.  
   if (\!undefined) {

   console.log('undefined is falsy');

   }  
   **// Output: "undefined is falsy"**

**null**

1. **Type**: `null` is also a primitive type in JavaScript, but it is considered a special value that represents "no value" or "empty value". Example \-  
   console.log(typeof null); **// Output: "object"**
2. **Explicit Assignment**: `null` is explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate that it should have no value. Example \-  
   let b \= null;  
   console.log(b); **// Output: null**
3. **Object Value**: `null` is often used to signify that an object reference is intentionally missing or empty. Example \-  
   let person \= { name: ‘Abhay’, work: null };  
   console.log(person.work); **// Output: null**
4. **Typeof Operator**: Using `typeof` on `null` returns "object", which is a known quirk in JavaScript.
5. It is used to explicitly indicate/check that a variable should be empty or have no value.
6. It is falsy value, which means evaluate to false in a boolean context. Example \-  
   if (\!null) { console.log('null is falsy');  
   // Output: "null is falsy" }

**Equality comparison**  
console.log(null \== undefined); **//Output: true (abstract equality comparison)** console.log(null \=== undefined); **//Output: false (strict equality comparison)**

### How do you select elements with vanilla JavaScript {#how-do-you-select-elements-with-vanilla-javascript}

### Explain event delegation in JavaScript {#explain-event-delegation-in-javascript}

Event delegation is a technique where instead of adding and event listener to each similar child element. You add a single event listener to a parent element. It leverages the event bubbling phase to catch events from child elements. Advantages include reduced memory usage (fever event listeners) and dynamically handling events from elements added after the initial page load.

### Explain NaN function

The Number.isNan() function is a standard JavaScrip function that returns true only if the argument given is not a number. If you string value, this method return true.

### Use enhanced object literals to create an object with methods and properties and log the object to the console

Enhanced object literals in JavaScript provide a more concise and readable way to define objects with properties and methods. This syntax includes shorthand for property names, method definitions, and computed property names.

const title \= "SDET with Playwright";  
const author \= "Abhay";  
const year \= 2023;

const book \= {  
 // Shorthand property names (when key and variable name are the same)  
 title,  
 author,  
 year,

// Method definition shorthand  
 getSummary() {  
 return \`${this.title} by ${this.author} (${this.year})\`;  
 },

// Computed property name  
 \['isOldBook'\]: function() {  
 return this.year \< 2015;  
 }  
};

console.log(book);

// Log the result of calling the method  
console.log(book.getSummary()); // Output: "JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford (2008)"  
console.log(book.isOldBook()); // Output: true

- **Built-In Test Runner**: Playwright comes with its own test runner, which offers parallel test execution, retries and many more features.
- Test Configuration: You can configure various settings such as test timeout, retires, report library, Global setup/teardown in **playwright.config.js** file
- **Debugging:** You can use **\--debug** flag to run tests in debug mode, which provides a more detailed output and pauses execution at breakpoints.
- **Trace Viewer:**

### Setup & Installation {#setup-&-installation}

- NodeJs : Playwright requires Node.js to be installed on your system. You can downloaded from [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Package Manager : npm(comes with Node.js) or yarn
- Aqua/IntelliJ/Visual Studio Code : IDE to write code

**How to Install**

- Create a new folder & initialise a Node.js project by running following command:

| npm init \-y |
| :----------- |

- ### This will create a package.json file in your folder.
- Install playwright by running following command:

| npm init playwright@latest |
| :------------------------- |

- Above command will create following files in your project

| \- playwright.config.ts \- package.json \- package-lock.json \- tests/ \- example.spec.ts \- tests-examples/ \- demo-todo-app.spec.ts |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

The \`**playwright.config.js/ts**\` is where you can add configuration for Playwright including modifying which browsers you would like to run Playwright on.

### Create a Test File and Test

In your project directory, create a file named [example.spec.ts/js](http://example.spec.ts/js) file

//example.test.js  
 import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("First Test", async ({ page }) \=\> {  
 //Navigate to https://google.co.in  
 await page.goto("https://google.co.in");

//Fetch page title  
 const title \= await page.title();

//Print title on console log  
 console.log(\`Page Title : ${title} \`);  
 });

### Run the Test

| npx playwright test ./tests/sample.test.js //You can specify exact test file to run Or npx playwright test //playwright will automatically find tests |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Updating Playwright version {#updating-playwright-version}

To update Playwright to the latest version run the following command:

| npm install \-D @playwright/test@latestnpx playwright install \--with\-deps |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

**Check version of Playwright:**

| :------------------------ |

### Setting up ESLINT and Prettier for code consistency

**Why ESLINT**  
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, ESLint is linting tool designed to analyse your code, pinpoint issues and guide you in rectifying potential problems in bot JS and TS code.It helps you to ensure coding standard and code quality.

**Why Prettier**  
Prettier focuses on maintaining a consistent, unified style throughout your codebase. It enforces code format and takes care of white space, semi colon nuances.

Install following dependency in your project  
ESLint and TypeScript dependencies  
npm install \--save-dev eslint typescript @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

Prettier and ESLint Prettier Plugin  
npm install \--save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier

Airbnb style guide  
npx install-peerdeps \--dev eslint-config-airbnb-base

- Create TypeScript configuration file( tsconfig.json)
- Create an ESLint configuration file(.eslintrc.js)
- Create a Prettier configuration file(.prettierrc)

### Managing Environment Variables

In an automation framework, setting variables at the operating system level \- known as environment variables, provides flexibility to test application in different env like from development (DEV), SIT to Production (PROD). It is important to store environment specific values such as the baseUrl in a centralised location. In JavaScript world, the go to solution is .env file. **Dotenv,** a Node.js library simplifies the loading and management of environment variables. By storing configuration details in the .env file, you can create a centralised repository for environment specific values, streamlining configuration changes across different testing stages.

- Create an **./environment** folder at the root level
- Create a \[environment name\].env file for each deployment stage
- Set a new NODE_ENV environment variables on your local machine
- Update playwright.config.ts to load environment variables

| // playwright.config.tsimport \* as dotenv from 'dotenv';switch(process.env.NODE_ENV){ case 'local': dotenv.config({path: './environments/local.env'}); break; case 'dev': dotenv.config({path: './environments/dev.env'}); break; case 'qa': dotenv.config({path: './environments/qa.env'}); break; default: dotenv.config({path: './environments/qa.env'});} |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Add scripts in the package.json to run tests in needed environments

| // package.json"scripts": { // ... "test": "echo %NODE_ENV% && npx playwright test", "test:local": "cross-env NODE_ENV='local' npm run test", "test:dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV='dev' npm run test", "test:qa": "cross-env NODE_ENV='qa' npm run test", // ...} |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

### **Best Practices in Test Authoring**

- ### **Create isolated test cases**: Each test case should be independent.

- ### **Write Meaningful Test Case Titles**: Make your test case titles descriptive and meaningful.

- ### **Follow the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) Pattern**: Align your Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach with the clarity of Arrange, Act, and Assert.

- ### **Maintain Cleanliness**: Separate additional logic from tests for a tidy and focused codebase.

## Generating Reports in Playwright

## Built-in Reporters

### List Reporter

The List reporter is the default reporter in Playwright. It provides a concise list of test results in the console.

| npx playwright test ./tests/sample.test.js \--reporter=list |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- |

**Report will look like this:**

## ![][image3]

If you click on test case name, detailed steps will be shown :  
![][image4]

### Dot Reporter

The Dot reporter offers a minimalistic view, representing each test with a single dot. This is particularly useful for running a large number of tests where detailed logs are not necessary.

| npx playwright test ./tests/sample.test.js \--reporter=dot |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- |

### Line Reporter

Line reporter is similar to List Reporter, the line reporter shows each test results on a new line but with more details including test duration. It is a good balance between detail and brevity.

| npx playwright test ./tests/sample.test.js \--reporter=line |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- |

### JSON Reporter

It generates test results in JSON format. You can use this for integrating with other tool or custom dashboard.

| npx playwright test ./tests/sample.test.js \--reporter=json |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- |

### JUnit Reporter

The JUnit reporter is designed for CI/CD pipelines and integrates well with various CI systems. It outputs results in the JUnit XML format, making it easy to generate detailed test reports.

| npx playwright test ./tests/sample.test.js \--reporter=junit |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- |

### HTML Reporter

The HTML reporter generates comprehensive and visually appealing HTML report. It is good for sharing with stakeholders who prefers a graphical interface.

| npx playwright test ./tests/sample.test.js \--reporter=html |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- |

### Configuring Custom Reporters

Playwright also supports custom reporters, allowing you to tailor reports to your specific needs. You can create a custom reporter by extending the **Reporter** class of Playwright.

Here is an example of a custom reporter:

- Create a [CustomReporterConfig.js/ts](http://CustomReporterConfig.js/ts) file in your project folder and add following code.

| import { FullConfig, FullResult, Reporter, Suite, TestCase, TestError, TestResult, TestStep, } from "@playwright/test/reporter"; const winston \= require(\`winston\`); const console \= new winston.transports.Console(); const logger \= winston.createLogger({ level: "info", format: winston.format.json(), transports: \[ // \- Write all logs with importance level of \`info\` or less than it new winston.transports.File({ filename: "logs/info.log", level: "info" }), \], }); // Writes logs to console logger.add(console); export default class CustomReporterConfig implements Reporter { constructor(options: { customOption?: string } \= {}) { console.log(\`playwright-framework-template ${options.customOption}\`); } onBegin(config: FullConfig, suite: Suite): void { logger.info( \`Test Suite Started : ${suite.title} , ${suite.allTests().length} tests\` ); } onTestBegin(test: TestCase): void { logger.info(\`Test Case Started : ${test.title}\`); } onTestEnd(test: TestCase, result: TestResult): void { logger.info( \`Test Case Completed : ${test.title} Status : ${result.status}\` ); } onStepBegin(test: TestCase, result: TestResult, step: TestStep): void { if (step.category \=== \`test.step\`) { logger.info(\`Executing Step : ${step.title}\`); } } onError(error: TestError): void { logger.error("TestError : ", error.message); } onEnd( result: FullResult ): void | Promise\< | void | { status?: "passed" | "failed" | "timedout" | "interrupted" | undefined } | undefined \> { console.log(\`Test Suite Completed : ${result.status}\`); } } |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---- | ------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Note : Logger is configured using library winston. If you do not want to use winston, you can use **console.log** also.

To use your custom reporter, specify the above file path in the Playwright configuration file (**playwright.config.ts/js file**).

export default defineConfig({  
 //  
 reporter: \[  
 //CustomReporterConfig.ts file path may vary in your case  
 \[\`./src/utils/report/CustomReporterConfig.ts\`\],  
 \["html", { open: "always", host: "127.0.0.1", port: 5723 }\],  
 \],  
 }

## Playwright Locators

### Types of Locators in Playwright

#### CSS Locators

CSS selectors like attribute, classes, ID and other CSS properties.

_//Locate an element using a CSS selector_  
 await _page_.locator("button.summit").click();

#### XPath

XPath is a popular method to navigate complex XML structure. It allows you to traverse the DOM tree in a more flexible manner than CSS.

#### TextContent

#### Role

### Advanced Locator Techniques

### Combining Locators

#### Wait for Locators

#### Assertions with Locators

### Custom Locator Strategies

#### Attribute Selectors

#### Multiple Selectors

#### Custom Selectors

#### Text with Regex

#### Shadow DOM

#### Frame Locators

#### Locator Functions

## Taking Screenshots

Screenshots are invaluable for several reasons:

- Visual Verification : confirm UI elements appear as expected.
- Debugging: Identify issues quickly by comparing expected and actual screenshots.
- Documentation: Provide visual evidence of test results.
- Report: Enhance test reports readability with visual context.

### Page Screenshots

To capture a screenshot of an entire page.

test("Launch twitter and take screenshot", async ({ _page_ }) \=\> {  
 await _page_.goto("https://x.com/i/flow/login");

_//capture a screenshot of the page_  
 await _page_.screenshot({ path: "screenshot.png" });  
 });

### Element Screenshots

To capture a screenshot of a specific element, first select the element and then use element.screenshot() method:

test("Take screenshot of an element", async ({ _page_ }) \=\> {  
 await _page_.goto("https://x.com/i/flow/login");

const element \= _page_.locator("h1");

_//capture a screenshot of the element_  
 await element.screenshot({ path: "screenshot.png" });  
 });

### Full Page Screenshots

Sometimes, you may need to capture the entire scrollable content of a page. You need to pass the fullPage flag.

test("Launch twitter and take screenshot", async ({ _page_ }) \=\> {  
 await _page_.goto("https://x.com/i/flow/login");

_//capture a screenshot of the page_  
 await _page_.screenshot({ path: "screenshot.png", fullPage: true });  
 });

### Clipping Screenshots

If your requirement is to capture a specific region of page, use the clip option to define the region’s coordinates and dimensions.

test("Launch twitter and take screenshot", async ({ _page_ }) \=\> {  
 await _page_.goto("https://x.com/i/flow/login");

_//capture a clipped screenshot_  
 await _page_.screenshot({  
 path: "screenshot.png",  
 clip: { x: 0, y: 0, width: 800, height: 800 },  
 });  
 });

### Configuring Screenshots Options

Playwright allows for additional configuration options to fine tune your screenshots.  
Type: Specify the image format(png or jpeg)  
Quality: Set the quality of JPEG images(1-100)  
Omit Background: Capture screenshots with a transparent background.

test("Launch twitter and take screenshot", async ({ _page_ }) \=\> {  
 await _page_.goto("https://x.com/i/flow/login");

_//capture a screenshot of the page_  
 await _page_.screenshot({  
 path: "screenshot.jpg",  
 type: "jpeg",  
 quality: 80,  
 omitBackground: true,  
 });  
 });

## Mastering Actions

Actions in Playwright refer to the various methods provided by the framework to simulate user interactions such as clicks, typing, dragging, and more. These actions help in automating the behavior of users on your web application, making it possible to test different scenarios and edge cases without manual intervention.

#### **Text input[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/input#text-input)**

Using [locator.fill()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-fill) is the easiest way to fill out the form fields. It focuses the element and triggers an input event with the entered text. It works for \<input\>, \<textarea\> and \[contenteditable\] elements.

_// Text input_  
await page.getByRole('textbox').fill('Peter');

## **Checkboxes and radio buttons[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/input#checkboxes-and-radio-buttons)**

Using [locator.setChecked()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-set-checked) is the easiest way to check and uncheck a checkbox or a radio button. This method can be used with input\[type=checkbox\], input\[type=radio\] and \[role=checkbox\] elements.

// Check the checkbox  
await page.getByLabel('I agree to the terms above').check();  
// Assert the checked state  
expect(page.getByLabel('Subscribe to newsletter')).toBeChecked();  
// Select the radio button  
await page.getByLabel('XL').check();

#### **Select options[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/input#select-options)**

Selects one or multiple options in the \<select\> element with [locator.selectOption()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-select-option). You can specify option value, or label to select. Multiple options can be selected.  
_// Single selection matching the value or label_  
await page.getByLabel('Choose a color').selectOption('blue');

_// Single selection matching the label_  
await page.getByLabel('Choose a color').selectOption({ label: 'Blue' });

_// Multiple selected items_  
await page.getByLabel('Choose multiple colors').selectOption(\['red', 'green', 'blue'\]);

#### **Mouse click[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/input#mouse-click)**

Performs a simple human click.  
_// Generic click_  
await page.getByRole('button').click();

_// Double click_  
await page.getByText('Item').dblclick();

_// Right click_  
await page.getByText('Item').click({ button: 'right' });

_// Shift \+ click_  
await page.getByText('Item').click({ modifiers: \['Shift'\] });

_// Ctrl \+ click or Windows and Linux_  
_// Meta \+ click on macOS_  
await page.getByText('Item').click({ modifiers: \['ControlOrMeta'\] });

_// Hover over element_  
await page.getByText('Item').hover();

_// Click the top left corner_  
await page.getByText('Item').click({ position: { x: 0, y: 0 } });

Under the hood, this and other pointer-related methods:

- wait for element with given selector to be in DOM
- wait for it to become displayed, i.e. not empty, no display:none, no visibility:hidden
- wait for it to stop moving, for example, until css transition finishes
- scroll the element into view
- wait for it to receive pointer events at the action point, for example, waits until element becomes non-obscured by other elements
- retry if the element is detached during any of the above checks

#### **Forcing the click[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/input#forcing-the-click)**

Sometimes, apps use non-trivial logic where hovering the element overlays it with another element that intercepts the click. This behavior is indistinguishable from a bug where element gets covered and the click is dispatched elsewhere. If you know this is taking place, you can bypass the [actionability](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/actionability) checks and force the click:

await page.getByRole('button').click({ force: true });

#### **Programmatic click[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/input#programmatic-click)**

If you are not interested in testing your app under the real conditions and want to simulate the click by any means possible, you can trigger the [`HTMLElement.click()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/click) behavior via simply dispatching a click event on the element with [locator.dispatchEvent()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-dispatch-event):  
await page.getByRole('button').dispatchEvent('click');

#### **Type characters**

Type into the field character by character, as if it was a user with a real keyboard with [locator.pressSequentially()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-press-sequentially).  
_// Press keys one by one_  
await page.locator('\#area').pressSequentially('Hello World\!');

This method will emit all the necessary keyboard events, with all the keydown, keyup, keypress events in place. You can even specify the optional delay between the key presses to simulate real user behavior.

#### **Keys and shortcuts[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/input#keys-and-shortcuts)**

_// Hit Enter_  
await page.getByText('Submit').press('Enter');

_// Dispatch Control+Right_  
await page.getByRole('textbox').press('Control+ArrowRight');

_// Press $ sign on keyboard_  
await page.getByRole('textbox').press('$');

The [locator.press()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-press) method focuses the selected element and produces a single keystroke. It accepts the logical key names that are emitted in the [keyboardEvent.key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) property of the keyboard events:  
Backquote, Minus, Equal, Backslash, Backspace, Tab, Delete, Escape,  
ArrowDown, End, Enter, Home, Insert, PageDown, PageUp, ArrowRight,  
ArrowUp, F1 \- F12, Digit0 \- Digit9, KeyA \- KeyZ, etc.

Simple version produces a single character. This character is case-sensitive, so `"a"` and `"A"` will produce different results.  
_// \<input id=name\>_  
await page.locator('\#name').press('Shift+A');

_// \<input id=name\>_  
await page.locator('\#name').press('Shift+ArrowLeft');

#### **Upload files**

ou can select input files for upload using the [locator.setInputFiles()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-set-input-files) method. It expects first argument to point to an [input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) with the type `"file"`. Multiple files can be passed in the array. If some of the file paths are relative, they are resolved relative to the current working directory. Empty array clears the selected files.  
_// Select one file_  
await page.getByLabel('Upload file').setInputFiles(path.join(\_\_dirname, 'myfile.pdf'));

_// Select multiple files_  
await page.getByLabel('Upload files').setInputFiles(\[  
 path.join(\_\_dirname, 'file1.txt'),  
 path.join(\_\_dirname, 'file2.txt'),  
\]);

_// Select a directory_  
await page.getByLabel('Upload directory').setInputFiles(path.join(\_\_dirname, 'mydir'));

_// Remove all the selected files_  
await page.getByLabel('Upload file').setInputFiles(\[\]);

_// Upload buffer from memory_  
await page.getByLabel('Upload file').setInputFiles({  
 name: 'file.txt',  
 mimeType: 'text/plain',  
 buffer: Buffer.from('this is test')  
});

If you don't have input element in hand (it is created dynamically), you can handle the [page.on('filechooser')](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-page#page-event-file-chooser) event or use a corresponding waiting method upon your action:  
_// Start waiting for file chooser before clicking. Note no await._  
const fileChooserPromise \= page.waitForEvent('filechooser');  
await page.getByLabel('Upload file').click();  
const fileChooser \= await fileChooserPromise;  
await fileChooser.setFiles(path.join(\_\_dirname, 'myfile.pdf'));

## **Focus element[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/input#focus-element)**

For the dynamic pages that handle focus events, you can focus the given element with [locator.focus()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-focus).  
await page.getByLabel('Password').focus();

## **Drag and Drop[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/input#drag-and-drop)**

You can perform drag\&drop operation with [locator.dragTo()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-drag-to). This method will:

- Hover the element that will be dragged.
- Press left mouse button.
- Move mouse to the element that will receive the drop.
- Release left mouse button.

await page.locator('\#item-to-be-dragged').dragTo(page.locator('\#item-to-drop-at'));

### **Dragging manually**

If you want precise control over the drag operation, use lower-level methods like [locator.hover()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-hover), [mouse.down()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-mouse#mouse-down), [mouse.move()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-mouse#mouse-move) and [mouse.up()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-mouse#mouse-up).  
await page.locator('\#item-to-be-dragged').hover();  
await page.mouse.down();  
await page.locator('\#item-to-drop-at').hover();  
await page.mouse.up();

## **Scrolling**

Most of the time, Playwright will automatically scroll for you before doing any actions. Therefore, you do not need to scroll explicitly.  
_// Scrolls automatically so that button is visible_  
await page.getByRole('button').click();

However, in rare cases you might need to manually scroll. For example, you might want to force an "infinite list" to load more elements, or position the page for a specific screenshot. In such a case, the most reliable way is to find an element that you want to make visible at the bottom, and scroll it into view.  
_// Scroll the footer into view, forcing an "infinite list" to load more content_  
await page.getByText('Footer text').scrollIntoViewIfNeeded();

If you would like to control the scrolling more precisely, use [mouse.wheel()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-mouse#mouse-wheel) or [locator.evaluate()](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-evaluate):  
_// Position the mouse and scroll with the mouse wheel_  
await page.getByTestId('scrolling-container').hover();  
await page.mouse.wheel(0, 10);

_// Alternatively, programmatically scroll a specific element_  
await page.getByTestId('scrolling-container').evaluate(e \=\> e.scrollTop \+= 100);

## Understanding Assertions : Types and Best Practices

Assertions are a component which checks if a particular condition is true or false. If condition is true, test passes; otherwise it fails.

### Type of Assertions in Playwright

#### Basic Assertions

- toBe Assertions :
- toEqual Assertions:
- toBeTruthy and tobeFalsy Assertions
- toBeNull and toBeDefined Assertions:

#### Advanced Assertions

Advance assertion offer more specialised checks.

- toHaveText:
- toHaveCount:
- toBeVisible and toBeHidden:
- toMatchSnapshot:

## Leveraging Power of Sharding with Playwright for Faster and Scalable Testing

Playwright offers a sharding feature that allows you to split your tests into smaller, manageable chunks that can run in parallel.This approach can significantly reduce the time required to complete your test suite.

- Sharing with Playwright
- Merging reports
- Integrating setup into CI pipelines

**Sharding Your Tests**

To shard your playwright tests, you need to pass \- \-shard option to the playwright CLI. The format for this option is \- \-shard=x/y, where x is the current shard number and y is the total number of shards.

npx playwright test \- \-shard=1 / 4  
 npx playwright test \- \-shard=2 / 4  
 npx playwright test \- \-shard=3 / 4  
 npx playwright test \- \-shard=4 / 4

Each of above commands runs a portion of your test suite. By running these commands in parallel on different machines or jobs, you can achieve a significant reduction in test execution time.

Note : Playwright sharding works best with tests that can be run in parallel, which usually means test files rather than individual tests.

**Merging Reports from Multiple Shards**  
When you shard your tests, each shard generates its own report. To get a unified view of all test results, you need to merge these projects. Playwright provides a blob reporter that captures detailed information about all tests, including attachments like screenshot and traces.

Here is how you can configure your playwright.config.ts to use blob reporter:  
 export default defineConfig({  
reporter: process.env.CI  
 ? "blob"  
 : "html",  
 })  
To merge the reports, first ensure all blob report files are in a single directory (e.g. all-blob-reports). Then run below command to merge them into single HTML report:

npx playwright merge-reports \- \- reporter html ./all-blob-reports

This command will produce an HTML report that aggregate the results from all shards.

**Integrating Sharding with GitHub Actions**

Github Actions allows you to run jobs in parallel, making it an ideal environment for sharding Playwright tests.

1. Configure Shards in Your Workflow:  
   Define a matrix strategy to create multiple jobs, each responsible for running a specific shard.

\# .github/workflows/playwright.yml
