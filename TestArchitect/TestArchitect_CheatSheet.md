Hello, Myself Abhay, I work as a Principal QE engineer at the Crestron Electronics, leading the test automation development at the XIO team, and have 15 years of experience with expertise in Designing and building the automation test frameworks and test suites for use in development and testing cycles.
Design and develop tools which will help Developers/Testers.
Collaborating with development teams and your team peers to identify and prioritize opportunities for automation.

## Problem Solving

## Coding Challenges

#### 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚

1. Check if a number is prime or not.
   A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 and is divisible by only 1 and itself. The prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has exactly two factors, 1 and the number itself. First few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23
   Except for 2, which is the smallest prime number and the only even prime number, all prime numbers are odd numbers.
   2 and 3 are only two consecutive natural numbers that are prime.

`Solution Approach : `

- Iterate through all numbers from 2 to square root of num
- For every number check if it divides num
- If we find any number that divides, we return false.

  `Time Complexity`: O(sqrt(n))
  `Auxiliary space`: O(1)

```
static boolean isPrime(int num) {
        //Check if number is less than equal to 1
        if (num <= 1) {
            return false;
        } else if (num == 2) { //Check if number is 2
            return true;
        } else if (num % 2 == 0) { //Check if n is multiple of 2
            return false;
        }

        //If not, then just check the odds
        for (int i = 3; i < Math.sqrt(num); i = i + 2) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

```

2. Swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.
3. Write a program to find the sum of all prime numbers within a given range (e.g., between 1 and 100)

`Solution Approach : `

- iterate through all numbers from 1 to 100
- check if number is isPrime()
- if yes, add in sum

```
   for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            if (isPrime(i)){
                System.out.println("Prime Number : "+i);
                primeNumberList.add(i);
                sum=sum+i;
            }
        }
     System.out.println(primeNumberList);
```

4. Find the factorial of a given number.
5. Reverse a string without using any built-in functions.

```
 public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Abhay";
        StringBuilder newStr = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = str.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            newStr.append(str.charAt(i));
        }
        System.out.println(newStr);
    }
```

can also use newStr.reverse(); method

6. Check if a string is a palindrome or not.
7. Generate Fibonacci series up to a given number.
8. Calculate the sum of digits in a number.
9. Find the maximum and minimum values in an array of integers.
10. Sort an array of integers in ascending order.

#### 𝐀𝐫𝐫𝐚𝐲𝐬

1. Find the second largest element in an array.
2. Remove duplicates from an array.
3. Find the sum of all elements in an array.
4. Check if two arrays are equal.
5. Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
6. Find the missing number in an array of consecutive numbers.
7. Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.
8. Find the common elements between two arrays.
9. Count the frequency of elements in an array.
10. Remove a specific element from an array and shift the remaining elements.

#### 𝐋𝐨𝐨𝐩 and 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬

1. Print numbers from 1 to 100, but replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz."
2. Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to n using a loop.
3. Check if a given year is a leap year or not.
4. Print the factorial of a given number using a loop.
5. Find the largest among three numbers using if-else conditions.
6. Generate a pattern of numbers using nested loops.
7. Print the reverse of a number using a while loop.
8. Calculate the average of numbers in an array using a for-each loop.
9. Implement a calculator program with options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
10. Determine if a given number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else conditions.

#### 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠

1. Count the number of vowels in a string.
2. Reverse words in a sentence without using built-in functions.
3. Check if a string is an anagram of another string.
4. Convert the first letter of each word in a string to uppercase.
5. Remove all white spaces from a string.
6. Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
7. Check if a string is a valid palindrome ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.
8. Count the occurrence of a specific word in a given string.
9. Concatenate two strings without using the concatenation operator.
10. Check if a string is a valid email address.
11. Find largest palindrome in a string

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

#### Problem Description

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

`Example 1:`

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1: a b c
word2: p q r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1: a b
word2: p q r s
merged: a p b q r s
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1: a b c d
word2: p q
merged: a p b q c d

##### Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

`Intuition`
The problem asks to merge two strings alternately. Therefore, we can traverse both strings at the same time and pick each character alternately from both strings.

`Approach`

- Initialize an empty string to store the merged result.
- Traverse both input strings together, picking each character alternately from both strings and appending it to the merged result string.
- Continue the traversal until the end of the longer string is reached.
- Return the merged result string.
  `Complexity`
  `Time complexity:`
  Since we traverse both strings once and pick each character alternately, the time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where n is the length of the longer string.

`Space complexity:`
We use a StringBuilder to store the merged string, so the space complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where n is the length of the longer string.

#### Solution:

```
String word1 = "ABC";
String word2 = "12389";
String finalStr = "";

        <!-- My Original Solution -->
        <!-- run initial iteration for length -->
        int iterationCount = word1.length();
        if (word1.length()>word2.length()) {
            iterationCount = word2.length();
        }else if (word1.length()<word2.length()){
            iterationCount = word1.length();
        }


        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < iterationCount; i++, j++) {
            String temp = String.valueOf(word1.charAt(i)) + String.valueOf(word2.charAt(j));
            finalStr = finalStr + temp;
        }
       if (word1.length() < word2.length()) {
            int extraLen = word2.length() - word1.length();
            for (int index = word1.length(); index < word2.length(); index++) {
                finalStr += word2.charAt(index);
            }
        } else if (word1.length() > word2.length()) {
            int extraLen = word1.length() - word2.length();
            for (int index = word2.length(); index < word1.length(); index++) {
                finalStr += word1.charAt(index);
            }
        }
        System.out.println(finalStr);
```

        <!-- Optimized solution -->

```
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int i =0;
        while (i<word1.length() || i<word2.length()){
            if (i<word1.length()){
                result.append(word1.charAt(i));
            }

            if (i<word2.length()){
                result.append(word2.charAt(i));
            }
            i++;
        }
        System.out.println(result.toString());
```

```
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
var mergeAlternately = function(word1, word2) {
 let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.max(word1.length, word2.length); i++) {
    if (i < word1.length) {result += word1[i];}
    if (i < word2.length) {result += word2[i];}
  }
  return result;
};

```

#### Reverse Words in a String

`Problem Description:`
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

Input: s = " hello world "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a good example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
There is at least one word in s.

`Code`

```
public String reverseWords(String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        //normalize whitespace in string
        String []tempArray = s.trim().split("\\s+");

        //run a for loop on string array
        for (int index = tempArray.length-1; index >=0; index--) {
            result.append(tempArray[index]);
            result.append(" ");
        }

        //concatenate the string elements

        return result.toString().trim();

    }

```

#### Find number of digits in array that have even number of digits

      nums =[18,129,9,1764,98,1]
      result = [18,1764,98] or 3 numbers

```
public class EvenDigit {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       int[] arr = {18, 129, 9, 1764, 98, 1};
       System.out.println(findEvenNumbers(arr));
       ;
   }

   /* Find number of digits tat have even number of digits
    *  nums =[18,129,9,1764,98,1]
    *  result = [18,1764,98] or 3 numbers
    * */
   private static int findEvenNumbers(int[] arr) {
       int count = 0;
       for (int num : arr) {
           if (even(num)) {
               count++;
           }
       }
       return count;
   }

   private static boolean even(int num) {
       return num > 0 && num % 2 == 0;
   }
}
```

#### Richest Customer Wealth

`Problem Description:`

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

Example 1:

Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
Example 2:

Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 10
3rd customer has wealth = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
Example 3:

Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17

`Solution`
Approach:

- declare maxWealth to store the maximum wealth
- declare tempWealth to store sum of wealth of a row
- loop over each money in account and calculate tempWealth
- if maxWealth < tempWealth, then maxWealth = tempWealth
- return maxWealth

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] accounts = {{1, 5}, {7, 3}, {3, 5}};
    }

    public int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {

        int maxWealth = Integer.MIN_VALUE; //initial value

        //person = row
        //account = col
        for (int[] ints : accounts) {

            //when  you start a new col, take a sum for that row
            int tempWealth = 0;
            for (int anInt : ints) {
                tempWealth += anInt;
            }
            if (maxWealth < tempWealth) {
                maxWealth = tempWealth;
            }
        }
        return maxWealth;
    }
```

`Time complexity:` O(n ^ 2)
`Space complexity:` O(1)

### Date Structure

Different type of DataStructure:

1. Linear Data Structure
    - Array
    - Linked List
    - Stack
    - Queue
2. Non-Linear Data Structure
    - Tree
    - Graph
3. Hash Based Data Structure
    - HashMap
    - HashSet

#### Array

<a target="\_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n60Dn0UsbEk&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=13"> Introduction to Arrays and ArrayList in Java </a>

Array is fundamental data structures in computer science and programming, has following advantages:

`Fix Size:` It is a fixed size.

`Sequential Storage:` Arrays provide a way to store elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory. This allows for efficient sequential access to elements, as the location of each element can be calculated using the index.

`Random Access:` Elements in an array are accessed using an index. This enables fast and constant-time access to any element, given its index. This is especially valuable when you need to access or modify elements at arbitrary positions in the array.

`Memory Efficiency:` Arrays have a fixed size, and they allocate memory in a single block. This results in better memory efficiency compared to some other data structures, as there is no need for additional memory to store pointers or links between elements.

`Simplified Syntax:` Arrays provide a straightforward and simple way to represent and manipulate collections of elements. The syntax for accessing elements is usually concise and easy to understand.

`Efficient for Fixed-Size Collections:` When the size of the collection is known and fixed, arrays can be a very efficient choice. The fixed size allows for direct access to any element, and the sequential storage simplifies various operations.

`Array Syntax:`

```
int [] intArray ; //declaration of array. intArray is getting defined in the stack.
int [] intArray = new int[5]; //initialization actually here object is being created in the memory(heap)
int [] intArray = {23,12,45,32,15};
```

- Array objects are created in heap. array objects in Java may not be contiguous (it depends on JVM).
- heap objects are not contiguous.
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Arrays are passed as call by reference in methods although in java primitives data types are always call by value.

`Traverse array`

```
    int[] intArray = {1, 3, 67, 89, 34};
    for (int i = 0; i < intArray.length; i++) {
        System.out.print(intArray[i]);
    }

    for (int num : intArray) { //for every element in array, print the element
        System.out.print(num); //here num represents element of the array
    }

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(intArray)); //[1, 3, 67, 89, 34]

```

`Multi-Diemensional Array`

- Array of arrays.

##### ArrayList

ArrayList is a part of the Java Collections Framework and is implemented in the java.util package. It is a dynamic array-like data structure that can dynamically grow or shrink in size.

`Create ArrayList`

```
//create an arraylist
ArrayList<String> myArrayList = new ArrayList<>();

//adding element
myArrayList.add("Element 1");
myArrayList.add("Element 2");

//accessing an element
String element = myArrayList.get(0);

//Updating an element
myArrayList.set(0, "Updated Element");

//Removing an element
myArrayList.remove("Element 1"); //using object
myArrayList.remove(1); //using index value

//printing arraylist values
for (String element : myArrayList) {
System.out.println(element);
}

//getting size of arraylist
int size = myArrayList.size();

//Checks if the ArrayList is empty.
myArrayList.isEmpty()

//Checks if the ArrayList contains a specific element.
myArrayList.contains("Abhay")

//Removes all elements from the ArrayList.
myArrayList.clear()

```

`Create 2D ArrayList`

```
 //creating 2D ArrayList
        ArrayList <ArrayList<Integer>> twoDArrayList = new ArrayList<>();
        twoDArrayList.add(new ArrayList<>()); //Adding a new row
        twoDArrayList.get(0).add(1);//Adding elements to the first row
        twoDArrayList.get(0).add(2);
        twoDArrayList.get(0).add(3);
        twoDArrayList.get(0).add(4);

        twoDArrayList.add(new ArrayList<>()); //Adding a new row
        twoDArrayList.get(1).add(5); //Adding elements to the second row
        twoDArrayList.get(1).add(6);
        twoDArrayList.get(1).add(7);
        twoDArrayList.get(1).add(8);

        //Accessing elements from the 2D ArrayList
        int element = twoDArrayList.get(0).get(3);
        System.out.println("Element at row 0, column 3 : "+element);

        //Iterating through the 2D ArrayList
        for (ArrayList<Integer> row : twoDArrayList){
            for (int value : row){
                System.out.print(value + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
```

##### Why primitive data type is not allowed in ArrayList

ArrayList is designed to store objects, and it cannot directly store primitive data types like int, char, double, etc. This limitation exists because generics in Java do not work with primitive types; they only work with reference types (objects).

The ArrayList class is part of the Java Collections Framework, and it is parameterized with a type parameter. Example :

```

        ArrayList<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>();

        integerList.add(42); // auto-boxing - primitive int is automatically converted to Integer

        int value = integerList.get(0); // auto-unboxing - Integer is automatically converted to int
        System.out.println(value); // prints 42

```

In above example, int values are automatically converted to Integer objects (autoboxing) when added to the ArrayList, and they are automatically converted back to int when retrieved (unboxing).

`Time Complexity of Array Operation`

- adding a value : O(1)
- retrieving a value : O(1)
- updating a value : O(1)
- finding a value : O(n) if array is unsorted, O (log n) - if array is sorted using binary search
- removing a value : O(1)
- Size increase : O(n)

#### Linear Search Algorithm - Theory + Code + Questions

<a target="\_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HRA37X8N_Q&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=14"> Linear Search Algorithm - Theory + Code + Questions </a>

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds a match or until the entire list has been searched.

- linear search has a time complexity of `O(n)`, where n is the size of the array. This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm may need to examine every element in the array to find the target value.
- Linear search is suitable for small lists or unsorted lists, but for large datasets, more efficient algorithms like binary search (for sorted lists) or hash-based searches may be preferable.

`Time Complexity :` Best Case : `O(1)` Worst Case : `O(n)` where n is size of array

```
 /*search in the array: return the index if item found, otherwise if item not found return -1*/
    static int linearSearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        //basic check
        if (arr.length == 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        //run a for loop
        for (int index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {
            //check for element at every index if it is equal to target
            int element = arr[index];
            if (arr[index] == target) {
                return index;
            }
        }
        /*return -1 if target element is not found in array*/
        return -1;
    }
```

#### Binary Search Algorithm - Theory + Code

<a target="\_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6UU7V3szVw&list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ&index=15"> Binary Search Algorithm - Theory + Code </a>

`Binary search` is an efficient algorithm for finding a specific value in a sorted collection (array or list). The basic idea behind binary search is to repeatedly divide the search interval in half.
This search alogirthm works if the array is sorted. If the array is not sorted, binary search cannot be applied, and you may need to use linear search or sort the array first.

- 100 items, binary search takes 7 guesses
- 4 billion items, it takes 32 guesses

How binary search works:

1. `Initialization`: Define the start (low) and end (high) indices of the search interval. Initially, the entire array is the search interval.

2. `Midpoint Calculation`: Calculate the midpoint (mid) of the search interval as mid = (low + high) / 2.

3. `Comparison`: Compare the value at the midpoint with the target value.

    - If the midpoint value is equal to the target, the search is successful, and the index is returned.
    - If the midpoint value is greater than the target, update high to mid - 1 and repeat the search in the
      left half.
    - If the midpoint value is less than the target, update low to mid + 1 and repeat the search in the right half.

4. `Repeat`: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the target is found or the search interval is empty (low > high).

##### Why Binary Search

`Time Complexity :`

- Best Case : `O(1)` when search time is at middle
- Worst Case : `O(log n)` where n is size of array

`Space Complexity :`

- The space complexity of the binary search is O(1)

`Solution :`

```
public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {-18, -12, -4, 0, 2, 3, 4, 15, 16, 22, 45, 89};
        int target = 22;
        int ans = binarySearch(arr, target);
        System.out.println("target : "+ans);

    }

    static int orderAgonsticBinarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {

        int end = arr.length - 1;

        /*find weather the array is sorted in ascending or descending*/
        boolean isAsc = arr[start] < arr[end] ? true : false;

        while (start <= end) {
            //find the middle element
            //int mid = (start+end)/2; // might be possible that (start+end) might see range error in Java
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2; //revised way to get middle number

            if (arr[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }

            if (isAsc) { //if array is in ascending order
                if (target < arr[mid]) {
                    end = mid - 1;
                } else if (target > arr[mid]) {
                    start = mid + 1;
                }
            }else{ //if array is in descending order
                if (target > arr[mid]) {

##### What is time complexity

Time complexity is not equal to time taken. Time complexity is a function which tells us amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as size of input grow.

Constant time complexity - O(1) < O(log n) < O(n)

What do we consider when thinking about time complexity?

- Always look for worst case complexity
- always look at complexity for large data
- Actual time vary on different machine, we care about relation. This is why, we ignore all constants
- Always ignore less dominating terms

`Different Time Complexity Example in the sequence of time:`

##### 1. O(1) - Constant time

An algorithm that always executes in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data.

- Odd or Even number,
- Look-up table (on average)

##### 2. O(log n) - Logarithmic time

Algorithms that have logarithmic time complexity are more efficient than linear time algorithms but less efficient than constant time algorithms. With every step, you eliminate 50% of input size. Binary search

- Finding element on sorted array with binary search

##### 3. O(n) - Linear time

The running time of the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input data.

- Find max element in unsorted array,
- Duplicate elements in array with Hash Map

##### 4. O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time

Common time complexity for many efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

##### 5. O(n^2) - Quadratic Time

The running time of the algorithm is proportional to the square of the size of the input data.

- Duplicate elements in array **(naïve)**,

- Sorting array with bubble sort

##### 6. O(n^3) - Cubic Time

- 3 variables equation solver

##### 7. O(2^n) - Exponential Time - The running time of the algorithm grows exponentially with the size of the input data.

- Find all subsets
- Traveling salesman problem

##### 8. O(n!) - Factorial Time

The running time of the algorithm grows factorially with the size of the input data.

- Find all permutations of a given set/string

## Amazon 14 leadership principles

### 1. Customer Obsession

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

### 2. Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

### 3. Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

### 4. Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

### 5. Learn and Be Curious

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

### 6. Hire and Develop the Best

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

### 8. Think Big

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

### 9. Bias for Action

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

### 10. Frugality

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

### 11. Earn Trust

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

### 12. Dive Deep

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

### 14. Deliver Results

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

### 15. Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer

Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

### 16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility

We started in a garage, but we’re not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them.
