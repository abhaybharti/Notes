# Day 17 : Data Structures

## Task Activities

### Activity 1: Linked List

#### Task 1 : Implement a Node class to represent an element in a linked list with properties values and next.

#### Task 2 : Implement a LinkedList class with method to add node to the end, removed a node from the end, and display all nodes.

### Activity 2: Stack

#### Task 3 : Implement a stack class with method push (add element), pop(remove element) and peek (view top element).

#### Task 4 : Use the stack class to reverse a string by pushing all characters onto the stack and then popping them off.

### Activity 3: Queue

#### Task 5 : Implement a Queue class with methods enqueue (add element), and front (view the first element).

#### Task 6 : Use the Queue class to simulate a simple printer queue where print jobs are added to the queue and processed in order.

### Activity 4: Binary Tree

#### Task 7 : Implement a TreeNode class to represent a node in binary tre with properties value,left and right.

#### Task 8 : Implement a BinaryTree class with methods for inserting values and performing in-order traversal to display nodes.

### Activity 5: Graph (Optional)

#### Task 9 : Implement a Graph class with methods to add vertices, add edges and perform a breadth-first search (BFS).

#### Task 10 : Use the Graph class to represent a simple network and perform BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes.

## Feature Request:

1. `Linked List Script`: Write a script that implements a linked list with methods to add, remove and display notes.
2. `Stack Script Script`: Create a script that implements a stack and uses it to reverse a string.
3. `Queue Script`: Write a script that implements a queue and simulates a printer queue.
4. `Binary Tree Script`: Create a script that implements a binary tree with insertion and in-order traversal methods
5. `Graph Script`: Write a script that implements a graph and performs bread-first search(optional)

## Achievements

By the end of these activities, students will

- Implement and use linked list for dynamic data storage
- Use stack for LIFO (Last In First Out) operations and reverse data.
- Use queue for FIFO (First In First Out) operations and simulate real-world scenarios.
- Implement binary trees for hierarchical data storage and traversal
- Understand and use graphs for network representation and pathfinding (optionals).
