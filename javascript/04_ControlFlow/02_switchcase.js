#VSCODE tips to copy/paste/delete code using keyboard shortcut
1. Duplicate a Line/Code Block: place your cursor on a line or select a code block & press [Shift + Alt+ Down Arrow key]. Code will be duplicated.
2. Delete a Line/Code Block: place your cursor on a line or select a code block & press [Crtl + Shift + k]. Code will be removed.
3. Paste from history of all Copy/Cut items: There is no inbuilt feature available in #VSCODE. Here is a workaround, install extension #Clipboard Manager. This extension keeps history of copy/cut operation in VS Code. Press [Crtl + Shift + V], it will show history of values, you can select which one you want to paste.
